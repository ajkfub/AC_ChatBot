    "Definition of General Ledger Account": "A general ledger account is an account or record used to sort, store and summarize a company’s transactions. These accounts are arranged in the general ledger (and in the chart of accounts) with the balance sheet accounts appearing first followed by the income statement accounts.",
    "Examples of General Ledger Accounts": "Some of the more common balance sheet accounts and how they are further arranged in the general ledger include:",
    "General Ledger Control Accounts": "Some general ledger accounts can become summary records and will be referred to as control accounts. In that situation all of the detail that supports the summary amounts in one of the control accounts will be available in a subsidiary ledger.",
    "Examples of General Ledger Control Accounts": "A common example of a general ledger account that can become a control account is Accounts Receivable. The summary amounts are found in the Accounts Receivable control account and the details for each customer’s credit activity will be contained in the Accounts Receivable subsidiary ledger. Other general ledger accounts that may become control accounts include Inventory, Equipment, and Accounts Payable.",
    "Sales Tax Calculation": "To calculate the sales tax that is included in a company’s receipts, we first calculate the amount of sales revenue that the company has earned. (Keep in mind that in this situation the receipts consist of 1) the sales revenue that will be reported on the company’s income statement, and 2) the sales tax that will be reported as a current liability on the company’s balance sheet.) To calculate the true sales revenue, we divide the total receipts (for the items that are subject to sales tax) by “1 + the sales tax rate”. If the sales tax rate is 6%, we divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.06. If the sales tax rate is 7.25%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.0725. To determine the sales tax that was collected and belongs to the state and local governments, multiply the true sales revenue amount times the sales tax rate.",
    "Example of the Sales Tax Calculation": "As an example, assume that all of the items in a vending machine are subject to a sales tax of 7%. During the most recent month, the vending machine receipts were $481.50. Therefore, $481.50 includes 1) the company’s revenue from the sale of its products, and 2) the sales tax pertaining to the sales revenue. Algebra is used to separate the $481.50 of receipts into the sales revenue and the sales tax on the sales revenue. To illustrate, let S = the sales revenue (which excludes the sales tax) and let 0.07S = the sales tax on the sales revenue. Since the sales revenue + the sales tax = $481.50, we can state this as S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $481.50. We solve for S by dividing $481.50 by 1.07. The result indicates that the true sales revenue was $450. The 7% of sales tax on the true sales revenue is $31.50 ($450 X 0.07). To make sure our math is correct, we add the amounts: $450 of sales revenue + $31.50 of sales tax = $481.50, which agrees with the vending machine receipts.",
    "Additional Example of the Sales Tax Calculation": "Now let’s assume that another company sold products which are subject to a 7% sales tax. Its receipts were $32,100 which included the sales tax. We designate S as the true sales revenue. Therefore, the sales tax will be 0.07S. As a result, S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $32,100. The sales revenue, S, will be $30,000 ($32,100 divided by 1.07). The sales tax on the sales revenue will be 0.07 X $30,000 = $2,100. Our proof is $30,000 of sales revenue + $2,100 of sales tax = $32,100. In general journal form the accounting entry to record this information is: debit Cash $32,100; credit Sales or Sales Revenue $30,000; credit Sales Tax Payable $2,100.",
    "Definition of Accounts Payable": "Accounts payable involves the amounts owed by a company to its suppliers (vendors) for goods or services the company received on credit. Accounts payable is also referred to as trade payables.",
    "Definition of Accounts Receivable": "Accounts receivable is a current asset account in which a company records the amounts it has a right to collect from customers who received goods or services on credit.",
    "Examples of Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable": "Let’s assume that Company A sells merchandise to Company B on credit (with payment due 30 days later). Company A will record the amount of the sale with a credit to Sales and a debit to Accounts Receivable. Company B will record the purchase (perhaps as inventory) with a credit to Accounts Payable. When the amount of the credit sale is remitted, Company B will debit its liability Accounts Payable and will credit Cash. Company A will debit Cash and will credit its current asset Accounts Receivable. Symmetry with Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable\nOur examples show that there are two sides to every transaction (which some people refer to as symmetry).\nAt the time of the sale:",
    "Definition of Accruals": "The accrual of expenses and liabilities refers to expenses and/or liabilities that a company has incurred, but the company has not yet paid or recorded the transaction. The accrual of an expense will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company’s expenses and increases its current liabilities. The accrual of revenues and assets refers to revenues and/or assets that a company has earned, but the company has not yet received the money nor has it recorded the transaction. The accrual of revenues will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company’s revenues and increases its current assets.",
    "Example of an Accrual of an Expense": "One example of an accrual of an expense and liability is a major repair that occurs in the final month of the accounting year, but is not paid until the bill is received in the first month of the following year. For the current year’s financial statements to be complete (under the accrual method of accounting) the following is necessary:",
    "Example of an Accrual of Revenues": "One example of an accrual of revenues occurs at your electric utility company. For instance, during December the utility likely uses natural gas and/or coal plus many employees to generate the electricity used by its customers in December. However, the utility does not bill its customers for that electricity until after it reads the meters in January. As a result, the utility’s financial statements will need an accrual adjustment so that:",
    "Definition of Debtor": "A debtor is a person, company, or other entity that owes money. In other words, the debtor has a debt or legal obligation to pay the amount owed. ",
    "Definition of Creditor": "A creditor could be a bank, supplier or person that has provided money, goods, or services to a company and expects to be paid at a later date. In other words, the company owes money to its creditors and the amounts should be reported on the company’s balance sheet as either a current liability or a non-current (or long-term) liability.",
    "Examples of a Debtor and a Creditor": "Assume that a company borrows money from its bank. The company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.  If a manufacturer sells merchandise to a retailer with terms of net 30 days, the manufacturer is the creditor and retailer is the debtor.",
    "Definition of Cost of Goods Sold": "The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that have been sold to customers during the period of the income statement. How the costs flow out of inventory will have an impact on the company’s cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold will likely be the largest expense reported on the income statement.",
    "Examples of Calculating the Cost of Goods Sold": "One way to calculate a retailer’s cost of goods sold is to begin with the cost of the goods it had purchased during the accounting period and then adjust it for the change in inventory. For example, if 1,000 units of a company’s only product were purchased but its inventory increased by 100 units, then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units of the product  were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold. Using dollar amounts, let’s assume that a retailer’s cost of its merchandise purchases for a year was $300,000 while the cost of its inventory increased from $100,000 to $120,000. The result is that its cost of goods sold is $280,000 (purchases of $300,000 minus the $20,000 increase in inventory). A second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is: the cost of the beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available – cost of ending inventory. Using the amounts above, we have $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000 – $120,000 = $280,000. If the cost of the ending inventory were $65,000, the cost of goods sold would have been $335,000 (purchases of $300,000 + the $35,000 decrease in inventory). ",
    "Cost Flow Assumption Is Needed": "When costs change during the accounting period, a cost flow will have to be assumed. Some common cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average.",
    "Definition of Owner’s Equity": "Owner’s equity is one of the three main sections of a sole proprietorship’s balance sheet and one of the components of the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.  Owner’s equity represents the owner’s investment in the business minus the owner’s draws or withdrawals from the business plus the net income (or minus the net loss) since the business began. Owner’s equity is viewed as a residual claim on the business assets because liabilities have a higher claim. Owner’s equity can also be viewed (along with liabilities) as a source of the business assets.",
    "Example of Owner’s Equity": "If a sole proprietorship’s accounting records indicate assets of $100,000 and liabilities of $70,000, the amount of owner’s equity is $30,000. Due to the cost principle (and other accounting principles) the amount of owner’s equity should not be considered to be the fair market value of the business.",
    "Definition of the Accrual Basis of Accounting": "The accrual basis of accounting provides a better picture of a company’s profits during an accounting period for the following reasons:",
    "Definition of Petty Cash": "Petty cash is a small amount of currency and coins that a company has available to make very small payments instead of requesting and processing a company check. The amount of the petty cash fund is recorded in a current asset account entitled Petty Cash when the petty cash fund is established.",
    "Examples of Petty Cash Payments": "Some examples of small payments made from petty cash include:",
    "Definition of Prepaid Expenses": "Prepaid expenses are future expenses that have been paid in advance. In other words, prepaid expenses are costs that have been paid but are not yet used up or have not yet expired. Generally, the amount of prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year are reported on a company’s balance sheet as a current asset. As the amount expires, the current asset is reduced and the amount of the reduction is reported as an expense on the income statement.",
    "Example of Prepaid Expenses": "A common prepaid expense is the six-month insurance premium that is paid in advance for insurance coverage on a company’s vehicles. The amount paid is often recorded in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance. If the company issues monthly financial statements, its income statement will report Insurance Expense which is one-sixth of the six-month premium. The balance in the account Prepaid Insurance will be the amount that is still prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet.",
    "Accrued Expenses": "Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company’s general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.",
    "Example of an Accrued Expense": "To illustrate an accrued expense, let’s assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.",
    "Recording an Accrued Expense": "Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company’s financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).",
    "Definition of Control Account": "A control account is a general ledger account containing only summary amounts. The details for each control account will be found in a related (but separate) subsidiary ledger. The control account keeps the general ledger free of details, but still has the correct balance for preparing the company’s financial statements.",
    "Example of Control Accounts": "A common example of a control account is the general ledger account entitled Accounts Receivable. When it is used as a control account, it will contain only summary amounts, such as total credit sales for a day, total collections from customers for a day, total returns and allowances for a day, and the total amount owed by all customers. Hence, if you want to find the amount that a specific customer still owes for its purchases on credit, it will not be shown in the control account. To find the amount that a specific customer owes, its recent payments, and its recent purchases on credit, you will quickly get that information from the Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger. Control accounts could also be used for accounts payable, equipment, and inventory.",
    "Definition of General Ledger": "The general ledger contains the accounts used by the company to sort and store the amounts from all of the company’s transactions (including all of the payments, receipts, payroll, and general journal entries). These accounts are known as general ledger accounts. The amounts and balances in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare the company’s financial statements. ",
    "Definition of General Journal": "The general journal is described as the book of original entry. Today the general journal is used to record adjusting entries and transactions other than payments, receipts, or payroll. An entry in the general journal will include the date, the account with the amount that is to be debited, the account with the amount that is to be credited, and a brief description. After these relatively few transactions are recorded in the general journal, the amounts will be posted to the accounts indicated.",
    "Examples of Using the General Journal": "The following are examples of entries that will be recorded in the general journal:",
    "Definitions and Examples of Equity": "Equity has several definitions that pertain to accounting:",
    "Definition of Bank Debit Memo": "A bank debit memo is an item on a company’s bank account statement that reduces the company’s checking account balance.",
    "Examples of a Bank Debit Memo": "Some examples of a bank debit memo include the following withdrawals from a company’s checking account:",
    "Definition of Cost of Sales": "Cost of sales is often a line shown on a manufacturer’s or retailer’s income statement instead of cost of goods sold. The cost of sales for a manufacturer is the cost of its finished goods in its beginning inventory plus the cost of goods manufactured during the accounting period minus the cost of finished goods in ending inventory. The cost of sales for a retailer is the cost of merchandise in its beginning inventory plus the net cost of merchandise purchased during the accounting period minus the cost of merchandise in its ending inventory. The cost of sales does not include selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, or interest expense.",
    "Definition of Financial Accounting": "Financial accounting has its focus on the financial statements which are distributed to stockholders, lenders, financial analysts, and others outside of a corporation or other organization. Because of the many users,  the financial statements must comply with the generally accepted accounting principles, known as GAAP or US GAAP.",
    "Definition of Managerial Accounting": "Managerial accounting is also known as management accounting and it includes many of the topics that are included in cost accounting. Some of the managerial topics involve the computation of a manufacturer’s product costs that are needed for the external financial statements which must comply with US GAAP. Other topics involve analyses and reports that are not distributed outside of the company but are used by management in its decision making and in the planning and control of the business operations.",
    "Examples of Cash": "In accounting, a company’s cash includes the following:",
    "Definition of Cash Equivalents": "Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity date that was 3 months or less at the time of purchase. In other words, there is very little risk of collecting the full amount being reported.",
    "Examples of Cash Equivalents": "Examples of cash equivalents include: ",
    "Definition of Depreciation": "Depreciation is defined as the systematic expensing of the cost of an asset such as equipment, building, vehicle, etc. over the useful life of the asset.",
    "Example of Depreciation": "Assume that a sidewalk florist operates a cash only business. During the most recent year, the florist had cash revenues of $100,000, cash expenses of $70,000, and depreciation expense of $8,000. Therefore, the net income reported on its income statement was $22,000. (The depreciation pertains to a truck purchased in an earlier year.)",
    "Depreciation on the Income Statement": "The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement.  Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.",
    "Depreciation on the Balance Sheet": "The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet. Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays’ cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",
    "Definition of Contra Asset Account": "A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is expected to be a credit balance. It is described as “contra” because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.)",
    "Examples of Contra Asset Accounts": "The most common contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is associated with property, plant and equipment (plant assets). Accumulated Depreciation will be credited when Depreciation Expense is recorded. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation means that the cost of the property, plant and equipment will continue to be reported. Looking at the cost of the plant assets and the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation allows us to see how much of the plant assets’ cost has been depreciated and how much has not been depreciated. Another contra asset account is Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account appears next to the current asset Accounts Receivable. The account Allowance for Doubtful Account is credited when the account Bad Debts Expense is debited under the allowance method. The use of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts allows us to see in Accounts Receivable the total amount that the company has a right to collect from its credit customers. The credit balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts tells us how much of the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is unlikely to be collected. A less common example of a contra asset account is Discount on Notes Receivable. The credit balance in this account is amortized or allocated to Interest Income or Interest Revenue over the life of a note receivable.",
    "Definition of Debit": "In accounting the term debit indicates the left side of a general ledger account or the left side of a T-account. (The right side of an account or a T-account is the credit side.) Generally asset accounts have debit balances, while liabilities and owner’s (stockholders’) equity accounts have credit balances. This is consistent with the accounting equation where assets = liabilities + owner’s equity. In addition to the asset, liability, and owner’s equity accounts, the accounting system uses temporary accounts to sort and store the transaction amounts involving revenues and expenses. At any point, the balances in the revenue and expense accounts can be moved to the owner’s equity account. Since revenues cause owner’s equity to increase, the revenue accounts will have credit balances. Since expenses cause owner’s equity to decrease, expense accounts will have debit balances. Debits and credits are part of accounting’s double entry system. ",
    "Examples of Debit": "To illustrate the term debit, let’s assume that a company has cash of $500. Therefore, the company’s general ledger asset account Cash should indicate a debit balance of $500. If the company receives an additional $200, a debit of $200 will be entered and will result in the Cash account having a debit balance of $700. Sometimes the word charge is used in place of debit. For example, if a company spends $300 for advertising, a credit of $300 will be recorded in the Cash account, and an accountant might add “…and charge Advertising Expense for $300.” Another accountant might say “…and debit Advertising Expense for $300.”",
    "Definition of Reconciling an Account": "Reconciling an account is likely to mean proving or documenting that an account balance is correct.",
    "Examples of Reconciling an Account": "When a company reconciles its bank statement, it is reconciling the balance in its general ledger account Cash (or Cash: Checking Account) with the bank’s information. Prior to issuing a company’s financial statements, it is wise to reconcile every balance sheet account by collecting the information that supports the accounts’ ending balances. For example, the Accounts Receivable balance could begin by comparing the balance with an aging of the accounts receivable.  Another example is reconciling the balance in the general ledger account Utilities Payable. This might be accomplished by computing the daily cost of each utility that the company uses. The cost per day is then multiplied by the number of days since the last meter reading date shown on the utility bills that have already been recorded.",
    "Definition of Amounts in Parentheses": "Parentheses around a number could have a variety of meanings. For example, parentheses could indicate any of the following:",
    "Definition of Stocks": "Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates. Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation’s profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation’s board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation’s financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.",
    "Definition of Bonds": "Bonds payable are a form of long-term debt, which include a formal agreement to pay interest semiannually and the principal amount at maturity. The interest is an expense that reduces the corporation’s earnings and its taxable income.",
    "Definition of Cost Principle": "The cost principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. It is also known as the historical cost principle.  The cost principle requires that assets be recorded at the cash amount (or the equivalent) at the time that an asset is acquired. Further, the amount recorded will not be increased for inflation or improvements in market value. (An exception is the change in market value of a short-term investment in the capital stock of a corporation whose shares of stock are actively traded on a major stock exchange.)",
    "Example of Cost Principle": "The cost principle means that a long-term asset purchased for the cash amount of $50,000 will be recorded at $50,000. If the same asset was purchased for a down payment of $20,000 and a formal promise to pay $30,000 within a reasonable period of time and with a reasonable interest rate, the asset will also be recorded at $50,000. A long-term asset that will be used in a business (other than land) will be depreciated based on its cost. The cost will be reported on the balance sheet along with the amount of the asset’s accumulated depreciation. Further, the accumulated depreciation cannot exceed the asset’s cost.  The cost principle prohibits a company from recording an asset that was not acquired in a transaction. Hence, a company cannot report its highly successful management team as an asset nor can it report its highly valuable trademark that it developed over many years. (As a result of the cost principle, some of a company’s most valuable assets will not appear as assets on the company’s balance sheet.) On the other hand, if the company acquires a competitor’s trademark in a $3 million transaction, that trademark will be reported as an asset at its cost of $3 million.",
    "Definition of Trial Balance": "A trial balance is an internal report that remains in the accounting department. The trial balance lists all of the accounts in the general ledger and their balances (or all of the accounts that have balances). However, the debit balance amounts are entered in one column and the credit balance amounts are entered in another column. Each column is then summed to prove that the total of the debit balances is equal to the total of the credit balances. (In a manual accounting system, the trial balance would draw attention to the errors occurring when transactions were journalized, posted, account balances computed, etc. With accounting software, these clerical errors are unlikely.)",
    "Definition of Balance Sheet": "The balance sheet is prepared in order to report an organization’s financial position at the end of an accounting period, such as midnight on December 31. A corporation’s balance sheet reports its:",
    "Definition of a Loan Payment": "A loan payment is likely to consist of three amounts:",
    "Example of Loan Payment": "Let’s assume that a company has a loan payment of $2,000 consisting of an interest payment of $500 and a principal payment of $1,500. The company’s entry to record the loan payment will be:",
    "Definition of Nominal Account": "The balance in a nominal account is closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a nominal account begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Since the balance does not carry forward to the next accounting year, a nominal account is also referred to as a temporary account.",
    "Examples of Nominal Accounts": "The nominal accounts are almost always the income statement accounts such as the accounts for recording revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the income statement accounts are closed at the end of the accounting year, the net amount will ultimately end up in a balance sheet equity account such as the proprietor’s capital account or the corporation’s retained earnings account.",
    "Definition of Account": "In accounting, an account is a record in the general ledger that is used to sort and store transactions. For example, companies will have a Cash account in which to record every transaction that increases or decreases the company’s cash. Another account, Sales, will collect all of the amounts from the sale of merchandise. Most accounting systems require that every transaction will affect two or more accounts. For example, a cash sale will increase the Cash account and will increase the Sales account. The term account is also used in transactions where suppliers sell goods to customers and grant credit terms such as net 10 days. In those situations, a supplier is selling goods on account and the customer has purchased goods on account. The supplier has also increased the balance in its current asset account entitled Accounts Receivable and the customer will increase the balance in its current liability account entitled Accounts Payable.",
    "Definition of Cash Flow Statement": "The cash flow statement (officially known as the statement of cash flows) is one of the required financial statements issued by U.S. businesses (and by not-for-profit organizations). The cash flow statement reports a company’s major cash inflows and cash outflows during the same period as the company’s income statement. The cash flow statement is important because the income statement reflects the accrual method of accounting. This means the income statement reports revenues when they are earned (not when money is received) and expenses and losses when they occur (not when money is paid out). The cash flow statement concludes by showing that its amounts agree to the change in the company’s cash and cash equivalents from the beginning to the end of the accounting period. ",
    "Purpose of Cash Flow Statement": "The purpose of the cash flow statement is to provide the readers of a company’s financial statement with the cash amounts that flowed in and out of the company. This is needed because the accrual basis of accounting requires the income statement to show the revenues that were earned (not the money actually received) and the expenses incurred or matched to the accounting period (not the money actually spent). For example, the money invested by owners and the money received from lenders will not appear on the income statement. Neither will the money spent to repay loans or money spent for equipment or buildings. In addition to the cash amounts arranged into three types of activities (operating, investing, and financing), the cash flow statement discloses the amount of interest paid, the amount of income taxes paid, and significant investing and financing activities that did not require the use of cash.",
    "Deferred Revenue": "Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company’s balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability. The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).",
    "Example of Deferred Revenue": "To illustrate deferred revenue, let’s assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received. Now let’s assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues. As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company’s remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).",
    "Definition of Expense": "An expense is a cost that a company incurs or uses up when it earns revenues.",
    "Examples of Expenses": "A few examples of the many expenses that a company incurs in earning revenues are:",
    "Definition of Expenditure": "An expenditure is a payment or disbursement. The expenditure may be for the purchase of an asset, a reduction of a liability, a distribution to the owners, or it could be payment in the same accounting period as the amount becomes an expense.",
    "Examples of Expenditures": "Examples of expenditures that will not be an expense in the accounting period in which the payments are made include the purchase of land for a future expansion and the principal portion of a monthly loan payment. Here is an example to illustrate the difference between an expense and an expenditure. A company makes an expenditure of $255,500 to purchase equipment. The expenditure occurs on a single day and the equipment is immediately placed in service. Assuming the equipment will be used for seven years, the asset’s cost could be reported on the income statement as depreciation expense of $100 per day for the next 2,555 days (7 years of use).",
    "Definition of Gross Margin": "Gross margin is the amount remaining after a retailer or manufacturer subtracts its cost of goods sold from its net sales. In other words, gross margin is the retailer’s or manufacturer’s profit before subtracting its selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses.",
    "Example of Calculating the Markup on Cost to Earn a Specified Gross Margin": "Since you know the cost of a product and you know the gross margin percentage to be achieved, you can determine the selling price and the markup needed. Let’s begin by assuming that a company’s product has a cost of $75 and the company desires a 25% gross margin (or 25% of the selling price). Let’s use “SP” to indicate the product’s required selling price and “MU$” to represent the gross profit, and state the gross margin as 0.25SP. This means that:",
    "Definition of Statement of Financial Position": "The statement of financial position is another name for the balance sheet. It is one of the main financial statements. The statement of financial position reports an entity’s assets, liabilities, and the difference in their totals as of the final moment of an accounting period. The structure of the statement of financial position is similar to the basic accounting equation. For a corporation the format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity. A nonprofit organization’s format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets. The statement of financial position must reflect the basic accounting principles and guidelines such as the cost, matching, and full disclosure principle to name a few. Accordingly, the statement of financial position is more meaningful when it is prepared under the accrual method of accounting.",
    "Examples of Creditors": "Some creditors, such as banks and other lenders, have lent money to the company and will require the company to sign a written promissory note for the amount owed. When a promissory note is required, the company borrowing the money will record and report the amount owed as Notes Payable. If the creditor is a vendor or supplier that did not require the company to sign a promissory note, the amount owed is likely to to be reported as Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities. Other creditors include the company’s employees (who are owed wages and bonuses), governments (who are owed taxes), and customers (who made deposits or other prepayments). Some creditors are referred to as secured creditors because they have a registered lien on some of the company’s assets. A creditor without a lien (or other legal claim) on the company’s assets is an unsecured creditor.",
    "Definition of Assets": "In accounting and bookkeeping, a company’s assets can be defined as:",
    "Example of Assets": "Examples of assets that are likely to be listed on a company’s balance sheet include: cash, temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, long-term investments, land, buildings, machines, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, goodwill, and more.",
    "Connection between Balance Sheet and Income Statement": "The connection between the balance sheet and the income statement results from:",
    "Example of How the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Are Connected": "To illustrate the connection between the balance sheet and income statement, let’s assume that a company’s owner’s equity was $40,000 at the beginning of the year, and it was $65,000 at the end of the year. Let’s also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner’s equity is likely the company’s net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company’s income statement for the year. Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner’s capital account at the end of the year.",
    "Definition of Accounting Principles, Assumptions, and Concepts": "The basic underlying accounting principles, assumptions, and concepts include the following:",
    "Definition of Balance Sheet Accounts": "Balance sheet accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the income statement accounts.)  Balance sheet accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving a company’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s or stockholders’ equity. The balances in these accounts as of the final moment of an accounting year will be reported on the company’s end-of-year balance sheet. Balance sheet accounts are also referred to as permanent or real accounts because at the end of the accounting year the balances in these accounts are not closed. Instead, the ending balances will be carried forward to become the beginning balances in the next accounting year. (This is different from the income statement accounts which are closed at the end of each accounting year and will begin the following year with zero balances.)",
    "Examples of Balance Sheet Accounts": "Examples of a corporation’s balance sheet accounts include Cash, Temporary Investments, Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Investments, Land, Buildings, Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures,  Accumulated Depreciation, Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Payroll Taxes Payable, Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and others.",
    "Definition of GAAP": "GAAP is the acronym for the phrase generally accepted accounting principles  or US GAAP. GAAP is required for a U.S. company’s external financial statements. One of the basic underlying principles in GAAP is the cost principle. This means that the inventories, the cost of goods sold, and the resulting net income must reflect the manufacturer’s actual historical costs.",
    "Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles": "The basic underlying accounting principles consist of the following:",
    "Why GAAP is Important": "In order for investors, bankers, financial analysts, portfolio managers, etc. to make informed decisions, it is necessary to have financial statements that are consistent and which can be compared to the financial statements of other corporations. This is more likely to occur when there are common rules for financial reporting. When financial statements are distributed by a business or other organization, the common rules that must be followed are known as generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.",
    "Definition of Noncurrent Asset": "A noncurrent asset is an asset that is not  expected to turn to cash within one year of date shown on a company’s balance sheet. (This assumes that the company has an operating cycle of less than one year.) A noncurrent asset is also known as a long-term asset. Noncurrent assets are reported under the following balance sheet headings:",
    "Examples of Noncurrent Assets": "Examples of noncurrent or long-term assets include:",
    "Definition of Accounting Cycle": "The accounting cycle is often described as a process that includes the following steps:",
    "Accounting Cycle Today": "The above steps were clear in a manual accounting system. However, today these steps are occurring with electronic speed and accuracy within sophisticated yet inexpensive accounting software. The accountant can enter adjusting entries into the software and can instantaneously obtain a complete set of financial statements by simply selecting them from a menu. After reviewing the financial statements, the accountant is able to make additional adjustments and almost immediately obtain the revised reports. The software will also prepare, record, and post the closing entries. It will also reverse adjusting entries that have been designated to be reversed.",
    "Reasons a Bank Balance Will Differ from a Company’s Balance": "Some of the reasons for a difference between the balance on the bank statement and the balance on the books include:",
    "How to Document the Differences": "Any items that are already recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts, but have not yet appeared on the bank statement (outstanding checks, deposits in transit), will be noted as an adjustment to the balance per bank statement. Outstanding checks are a deduction to the balance per bank; deposits in transit are an addition to the balance per bank. If an item is on the bank statement but has not yet been entered on the books, the items are noted as an adjustment to the balance per books. Bank service charges, check printing charges, and other electronic deductions that are not yet recorded in the company’s accounts will become deductions from the cash balance per the books. Electronic deposits not yet recorded by the company will become additions to the cash balance per books.",
    "Definition of Liability": "In accounting and bookkeeping, the term liability refers to a company’s obligation arising from a past transaction.",
    "Examples of Liabilities": "A few of the more common types of liabilities include:",
    "Definition of Debt": "When some people use the term debt, they are referring to all of the amounts that a company owes. In other words, they use the term debt to mean total liabilities. Others use the term debt to mean only the formal, written loans and bonds payable.",
    "Examples of Debt": "As an example of debt meaning the total amount of a company’s liabilities, we look to the debt-to-equity ratio. In the calculation of that financial ratio, debt  means the total amount of liabilities (not merely the amount of short-term and long-term loans and bonds payable). Others use the word debt  to mean only the formal, written financing agreements such as short-term loans payable, long-term loans payable, and bonds payable. This is a good reminder that people have different perspectives and understandings of accounting terms.",
    "Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment": "Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company’s operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company’s fixed assets or plant assets. Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).",
    "Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment": "Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets. ",
    "Definition of Operating Expenses": "Operating expenses are the costs that have been used up (expired) as part of a company’s main operating activities during the period shown in the heading of its income statement.",
    "Examples of Operating Activities": "Examples of a retailer’s main operating activities involve the buying and selling of merchandise or goods. Therefore, the retailer’s income statement will report the following operating expenses:",
    "Definition of Revenue": "Revenue is the amount a company receives from selling goods and/or providing services to its customers and clients. A company’s revenue, which is reported on the first line of its income statement, is often described as sales or service revenues. Hence, revenue is the amount earned from customers and clients before subtracting the company’s expenses. ",
    "Definition of Gain": "In accounting, a gain is the result of a peripheral activity, such as a retailer selling one of its old delivery trucks. A gain occurs when the cash amount (or its equivalent) received is greater than the asset’s carrying amount, which is also referred to as the asset’s book value. For example, if the company receives $3,000 for the old delivery truck, and the truck’s carry amount (book value) at the time of the sale was $600, the company will have a gain of $2,400.",
    "Definition of Income": "The term income is used differently by many people. For some, income means the money coming in, such as What is your family income? What is your interest and dividend income? Generally, accountants use the term revenue for the gross amount received, but the IRS may use the term income to mean the gross amount received. While accountants use the term revenues when referring to a company’s sales of its merchandise, the same accountants will use the term income to mean the amount a company received in interest and dividends on its investments. The investment interest and dividend amounts earned will be reported on the income statement as other income. To provide more clarity, accountants use the term net income to describe the amount remaining after expenses and losses are subtracted from revenues and gains. However, the income statements of large U.S. corporations will frequently use the term earnings instead of net income. ",
    "Examples of Expense": "Some of the expenses that will be reported on a retailer’s income statement for the month of August include:",
    "Definition of Write-down in Inventory": "Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.",
    "Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory": "Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory’s cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement. Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner’s equity or stockholders’ equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner’s or stockholders’ equity.",
    "Example of Debtor": "If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.",
    "Definition of Gross Profit": "Net sales – Cost of goods sold = gross profit?",
    "Example of Gross Profit": "Let’s assume that a manufacturer has net sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold (using absorption costing) is $39,000. Therefore, the manufacturer’s gross profit is $21,000 ($60,000 minus $39,000). The gross profit ratio or gross profit percentage is 35% (gross profit of $21,000 divided by net sales of $60,000).",
    "Definition of Net Profit": "The term net profit might have a variety of definitions. We will assume that net profit means a company’s net sales minus all expenses. The expenses include the cost of goods sold, the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and the nonoperating expenses and losses. Nonoperating revenues and gains would be an increase to the net profit. If the business is a regular corporation, net profit may mean after income tax expense.",
    "Example of Net Profit": "Assume that a sole proprietorship business had the following information for it most recent year:",
    "Definitions of Cost and Expense": "Some people use cost interchangeably with expense. However, we use the term cost to mean the amount spent to purchase an item, a service, etc. Some costs are not expenses (cost of land), some costs will become expenses (cost of a new delivery van), and some costs become expenses immediately (airing a television advertisement).",
    "Examples of Costs and Expenses": "Assume that a company purchases 2,000 units of a supply item each of which has a cost of $5. If none of the units have been used, the current asset supplies will be reported at the cost of $10,000 (2,000 units at $5 each). At the time of the next balance sheet, only 500 of the units are on hand and 1,500 units have been used in the business. As a result, the balance sheet will report the supplies on hand at their cost of $2,500 (500 units at $5) and the income statement will report supplies expense of $7,500 (1,500 units at $5). Assume that a company purchases a delivery truck to be used in its business. Initially the truck’s cost will be recorded in the asset account Delivery Truck. However, the truck’s cost will become Depreciation Expense as the truck is “used up” in the company’s revenue-generating activities.",
    "Definition of Budgeting": "Budgeting is the process of preparing detailed projections of future amounts. Companies often engage in two types of budgeting:",
    "Examples of Operational Budgeting": "In a business, the budgeting for operations will include preparing the following projections for the next accounting year:",
    "Example of Capital Budgeting": "Capital budgeting involves future projects which overlap several or many future accounting periods. Capital budgeting usually means listing each project along with its cash outlays and expected cash inflows for each year. The amounts should be discounted to their present values and also ranked by priority and profitability. Once prepared, the capital budget provides a guide for investing in future fixed assets as well as arranging for the financing of the projects. ",
    "Definition of Income Statement Accounts": "Income statement accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the balance sheet accounts.) Income statement accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving:",
    "Examples of Income Statement Accounts": "A few of the many income statement accounts used in a business include Sales, Sales Returns and Allowances, Service Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold, Salaries Expense, Wages Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, Advertising Expense, Automobile Expense, Depreciation Expense, Interest Expense, Gain on Disposal of Truck, and many more.",
    "Revenue vs Net Income": "While revenue is the top line on a company’s income statement, net income is often referred to as the bottom line. The difference between the amount of revenue and the amount of net income is significant. Here are some hypothetical amounts to illustrate the point:",
    "Calculating Revenue": "The best way to calculate a company’s revenue during an accounting period (year, month, etc.) is to sum up the amounts earned (as opposed to the amounts of cash that were received). For example, if a new company sold $75,000 of goods in December but allows the customer to pay 30 days later, the company’s December sales are $75,000 (even though no cash was received in December). Reporting revenues in the period in which they are earned is known as the accrual basis of accounting. Hence, a company’s revenue could occur before the cash is received, after the cash is received, or at time that the cash is received. (Note that for income tax reporting, smaller companies may use the cash basis of accounting.)",
    "Examples of Revenue": "Common examples of revenue include:",
    "Revenue vs Income": "It is important to note that many people use the term income to mean revenue. Perhaps a business owner sees money “coming in” from customers and logically refers to it as “income”. However, it is best to use the word sales or revenue when referring to the amounts earned from customers, and to use the word income for an amount that reflects the subtraction of expenses. ",
    "Reporting the Purchase of Equipment": "Assuming that the purchase of equipment is a long-term or noncurrent asset that will be used in a business, the purchase will not  be reported on the profit and loss statement (income statement, statement of earnings). Rather, the equipment’s cost will be reported in the general ledger account Equipment, which is reported on the balance sheet under the classification Property, plant and equipment. The purchase will also be included in the company’s capital expenditures that are reported on the  statement of cash flows in the section entitled cash flows from investing activities. When the equipment is placed into service, the company will begin to report depreciation expense on the profit and loss statements during the years that the equipment is used.",
    "Example of Equipment’s Cost on Income Statement": "Let’s assume that a company buys equipment for $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 10 years with no salvage value at the end of its useful life. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, each year’s profit and loss statement will report depreciation expense of $10,000 for 10 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for the $10,000 of annual depreciation.",
    "Operating cycle definition": "The operating cycle is the time required for a company’s cash to be put into its operations and then return to the company’s cash account.",
    "Operating cycle example": "A manufacturer’s operating cycle is amount of time required for the manufacturer’s cash to be used to:",
    "Definition of Full Disclosure Principle": "The full disclosure principle requires a company to provide the necessary information so that people who are accustomed to reading financial information are able to make informed decisions regarding the company.",
    "Examples of Full Disclosure Principle": "The disclosures required under this principle can be found in a number of places, such as:",
    "Definition of Temporary Account": "A temporary account is a general ledger account that begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Then at the end of the year its account balance is removed by transferring the amount to another account. This is done through closing entries. Temporary accounts are also referred to as nominal accounts. All of the income statement accounts are classified as temporary accounts. A few other accounts such as the owner’s drawing account and the income summary account are also temporary accounts. ",
    "Examples of Temporary Accounts": "Temporary accounts include all of the various groups of income statement accounts:",
    "Definition of Cost": "A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. ",
    "Example of a Cost": "A company’s property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).",
    "Example of an Expense": "As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",
    "Definition of Capital Account": "In accounting and bookkeeping, a capital account is a general ledger account that is part of the balance sheet classification:",
    "Examples of Capital Accounts": "The sole proprietorship of J. Lee will include the following capital accounts:",
    "Other Information on Capital Accounts": "The total of the balances in all of the capital accounts must be equal to the reported total of the company’s assets minus its liabilities. Because of the historical cost principle and other accounting principles, the total amount reported in the capital accounts will not indicate a company’s market value.",
    "Definition of Unpaid Wages": "Unpaid wages are usually the amounts that hourly-paid employees have earned, but have not yet been paid to the employees. ",
    "Entering Unpaid Wages": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, unpaid wages that have been earned by employees but have not yet been recorded in the accounting records should be entered or recorded through an accrual adjusting entry which will:",
    "Definition of Going Concern": "The going concern assumption is a basic underlying assumption of accounting. For a company to be a going concern, it must be able to continue operating long enough to carry out its commitments, obligations, objectives, and so on. In other words, the company will not have to liquidate or be forced out of business. If there is uncertainty as to a company’s ability to meet the going concern assumption, the facts and conditions must be disclosed in its financial statements.",
    "Additional Comments": "Cost centers and profit centers are usually associated with planning and control in a decentralized company.",
    "Example of an Accrual as a Current Liability": "Assume that a company has an emergency sewer repair on December 30. The plumbing contractor said the bill will be finalized and mailed to the company on January 10; however, the bill will be approximately $6,000. Under the accrual method of accounting, the company must accrue this expense and liability prior to issuing its December 31 financial statements. This is accomplished by recording an adjusting entry that debits the income statement account Repairs Expense for $6,000, and credits the balance sheet current liability account Accrued Expenses Payable for $6,000. Examples of other expenses that typically require an accrual adjusting entry that increases a current liability account include wages, utilities, bonuses, taxes, and interest.",
    "Example of an Accrual as a Current Asset": "Assume that during December a company has earned interest of $5,000 on its investment in U.S. Treasury bills. However, all of the interest will be received by the company on February 15. Under the accrual method of accounting, the company must accrue the revenue it earned but had not received as of December 31. The adjusting entry dated December 31 will debit the balance sheet current asset account Interest Receivable for $5,000, and will credit the income statement account Investment Income for $5,000. Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale – Corporation Income Statement: Retail/Whsle – Corporation, Multiple-Step Statement of Cash Flows: Corporation, Indirect Method",
    "Definition of Interest Expense": "Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money during a specified period of time. Interest expense is occurring daily, but the interest is likely to be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.",
    "Example of Interest Expense": "Let’s assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. If the company borrows $100,000 on December 15 and agrees to pay interest on the 15th day of each month at the rate of 1% per month, the interest expense for the month of December will be approximately $500 ($100,000 x 1% x 1/2 month). The interest expense for the month of January will be $1,000 ($100,000 x 1%). In this example, as of December 31 no interest has been paid on the loan that began on December 15. However, the company did incur one-half month of interest expense. Therefore, the company needs to record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Expense for $500, and credits Interest Payable for $500. ",
    "Definition of Gross Profit Margin": "Gross profit margin is also referred to as the gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio. In that situation the calculation is:",
    "Example of Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin and Gross Margin": "Assume that in its most recent year a company had net sales of $80,000 and cost of goods sold of $60,000. As a result, the company had a gross profit of $20,000 ($80,000 minus $60,000) and a gross profit margin of 25% ($20,000 divided by $80,000). Some people will say the company had a gross margin of $20,000 while others will say the company had a gross margin of 25%. Others might say the company had a gross margin ratio of 25%.",
    "Definition of Income Statement": "The income statement is also known as the statement of operations, profit and loss statement, and statement of earnings. It is one of a company’s main financial statements. The purpose of the income statement is to report a summary of a company’s revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and the resulting net income that occurred during a year, quarter, or other period of time.",
    "Examples of Items Appearing in the Income Statement": "The main items reported in the income statement are:",
    "How the Income Statement Amounts are Calculated": "The income statement amounts are best calculated for a specific period of time by using the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis the revenues are the amounts that were earned (not the amount of cash received), and the expenses are the amounts that best match the revenues or were used up during the period (not the cash that was paid out).",
    "Definition of Revenue Expenditure": "A revenue expenditure is a cost that will be an expense in the accounting period when the expenditure takes place. Revenue expenditures are often discussed in the context of fixed assets. The revenue expenditures take place after a fixed  asset had been put into service and simply keeps the asset in working order. (The amount spent to acquire a fixed asset is referred to as a capital expenditure. The amount of the capital expenditure will be recorded as an asset and will then be moved to the income statement as depreciation expense over the years of the asset’s useful life.)",
    "Example of Revenue Expenditure": "Let’s assume that a company made a capital expenditure of $100,000 to install a high efficiency machine. The new machine requires routine maintenance of $3,000 each month. This $3,000 is a revenue expenditure since it will be reported on the monthly income statement, thereby being matched with the month’s revenues. Normal repairs to the machine are also a revenue expenditure, since the expenditure does not make the machine more than it was, nor does it extend the machine’s useful life. As a result, normal repairs will also be reported on the income statement as an expense in the accounting period when the repair is made.",
    "Why the Cost of Goods Sold is an Expense": "We often think of expenses as salaries, advertising, rent, commissions, interest, and so on. However, the cost of goods sold is also an expense that must be matched with the related sales. Hence, a company’s operating income is its operating revenues minus the cost of goods sold and its sales, general and administrative expenses. The FASB’s Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, paragraph 81, states that “…expenses themselves are in many forms and are called by various names—for example, cost of goods sold, cost of services provided, depreciation, interest, salaries and wages….”  You can read the concepts statements at www.FASB.org/st.",
    "Definition of Interest Payable": "Interest payable is the amount of interest the company has incurred but has not yet paid as of the date of the balance sheet. Interest Payable is also the title of the current liability account that is used to record and report this amount.",
    "Examples of Interest Expense and Interest Payable": "To illustrate the difference between interest expense and interest payable, let’s assume that a company borrows $200,000 on November 1 at an annual interest rate of 6%. The company is required to pay each month’s interest on the 15th day of the following month. Therefore, the November interest of $1,000 ($200,000 x 6% x 1/12) is to be paid on December 15. The $1,000 of interest incurred during December is to be paid on January 15. Therefore, as of December 31, the company’s current liability account Interest Payable must report $1,000 for December’s interest. For the two-month period, the company will report Interest Expense of $2,000 (November’s and December’s interest of $1,000 each month). ",
    "Definition of Debit Balance": "A debit balance is the normal balance in the general ledger accounts for assets, expenses, losses, and owner’s draws.",
    "Example of Debit and Debit Balance": "Let’s assume that a person starts a business as a sole proprietorship with an investment of $5,000. The entry to business accounts will include a debit to Cash for $5,000. On the next day, the business spends $1,000 to purchase office equipment. Part of this entry will include a credit to Cash for $1,000. After this transaction is recorded, the Cash account will have a debit balance of $4,000.",
    "Definition of Wages and Salaries Expense": "The account Wages and Salaries Expense (or separate accounts such as Wages Expense or Salaries Expense) are used to record the amounts earned by employees during the accounting period under the accrual basis of accounting.",
    "Example of Wages and Salaries Expense": "Assume that a new service business begins in December and has a staff of 6 hourly-paid employees who are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. As of December 31, the hourly-paid employees have earned $3,000 of wages for which they will be paid on the first Friday in January. In order to comply with the matching principle, the account Wages and Salaries Expense must include the $3,000 of wages in order to match the December wages expense with the December revenues. As a result, the December’s income statement will present an accurate picture of December’s profits and the balance sheet will report the liability for the wages owed as of December 31.",
    "Definition of Inventory": "Inventory is a very significant current asset for retailers, distributors, and manufacturers. Inventory serves as a buffer between 1) a company’s sales of goods, and 2) its purchases or production of goods. Companies strive to find the proper amount of inventory so that it can meet the fluctuating demand of its customers, avoid disruptions in production, and minimize holding costs. Since the costs of the items purchased or produced are likely to change (especially with inflation), companies must elect a cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and its cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the common cost flow assumptions are FIFO, LIFO, and average. A company’s cost of inventory is related to the company’s cost of goods sold that is reported on the company’s income statement.",
    "Examples of Inventories": "Retailers and distributors are likely to have one type of inventory, namely merchandise. Manufacturers will have three or four categories of inventories:",
    "Definition of Depreciation Expense": "Depreciation expense is the systematic allocation of a depreciable asset’s cost to the accounting periods in which the asset is being used. The depreciation of assets used in the manufacturing process are considered to be a product cost and will be allocated or assigned to the goods produced. The allocated depreciation will be included in the inventory cost of the goods manufactured until the goods are sold. When the goods are sold, the cost of goods sold will include the allocated depreciation. The depreciation of assets used in the business but outside of the manufacturing process will be reported as depreciation expense of the accounting periods. Generally, the depreciation of these assets will be part of a company’s selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). The depreciation of assets used in a company’s peripheral activities will reduce the company’s non-operating (or other) income. ",
    "Definition of Accumulated Depreciation": "Accumulated depreciation reports  the total amount of depreciation that has been reported on all of the income statements from the time that the assets were put into service until the date of the balance sheet. The account Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account because it will have a credit balance. The credit balance is reported in the property, plant and equipment section of the balance sheet and it reduces the cost of the assets to their carrying value or book value.",
    "Example of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation": "To illustrate, let’s assume that a retailer purchases new display racks at a cost of $84,000. This asset is estimated to have a useful life of 7 years (84 months) and no salvage value at the end of 7 years. Assuming the retailer uses the straight-line depreciation method, during each month of the display racks’ lives the retailer’s monthly income statement will report depreciation expense of $1,000. However, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be reported on the balance sheet at $1,000 at the end of the first month, $2,000 at the end of the second month, $3,000 at the end of the third month, etc. until the balance in Accumulated Depreciation reaches $84,000 at the end of the 84th month.",
    "Definition of Costs": "In the context of the question, costs are the amounts paid in exchange for materials, products, or services. The costs could be:",
    "Examples of Costs Being Expensed": "Costs are reported as expenses  in the accounting period when they are used up, have expired, or have no future economic value which can be measured. For example, the June salaries for the company’s marketing team should be reported as an expense in June since the future economic value cannot be measured/determined. Another example is the amount spent to repair equipment that broke in June and was repaired in June. The cost of the repair merely restored the equipment to its same condition. Since there was no additional future economic value added, the costs of repair is reported as an expense on the June income statement.",
    "Example of Costs Being Capitalized": "Costs are capitalized (recorded as assets) when the costs have not been used up and have future economic value. Assume that a company incurs a cost of $30,000 in June to add a hydraulic lift to its delivery truck that had no lift. The remaining useful life of the truck and the lift is 5 years. The cost of $30,000 should be capitalized since it added future economic value by making an improvement to the truck. The $30,000 cost increases the company’s assets, but will be reduced by depreciating the cost to expense over the next 5 years.",
    "Definition of Accounting Equation": "The accounting equation of a sole proprietorship is assets = liabilities + owner’s equity. For a corporation, the accounting equation is assets = liabilities + stockholders’ equity. The accounting equation is similar to the format of the balance sheet. The accounting equation will always remain in balance if the double entry system of accounting is followed accurately.",
    "Example of the Accounting Equation": "Let’s assume that a person starts a new sole proprietorship business by investing $10,000. The new business will now have: $10,000 of assets = $0 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner’s equity. Next, let’s assume the company purchases equipment at a cost of $3,000 and signs a promise to pay the $3,000 within six months. Now the company’s accounting equation will contain these amounts: $13,000 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner’s equity. Next, let’s assume the new company completes a service for another business and earns revenues of $1,500 and allows the business to pay in 10 days. This means the new company will have an account (or trade) receivable of $1,500 and will have an additional $1,500 of owner’s equity. After this transaction, the accounting equation will show: $14,500 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $11,500 of owner’s equity.",
    "Definition of Accounting Principles": "Accounting principles are the common rules that must be followed when preparing financial statements that are distributed to people outside of the company (or other organization).",
    "Examples of Accounting Principles": "The basic underlying accounting principles, guidelines and assumptions include the following:",
    "Effects of Depreciation": "The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:",
    "Definition of Carriage Outwards": "Carriage outwards refers to the transportation costs that a seller must pay when it sells merchandise with the terms FOB Destination. Carriage outwards is also referred to as freight-out, transportation-out, or delivery expense. The cost of carriage outwards should be reported on the income statement as an operating expense in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the goods. (Carriage outwards is not part of the cost of goods sold.) ",
    "Example of Carriage Outwards": "Assume that a supplier sells $700 of merchandise with the terms FOB Destination. The supplier ships the goods via United Parcel Service at a cost of $50. The supplier’s income statement will report sales of $700. In addition, it will report the operating expense carriage outwards (or delivery expense) of $50. ",
    "Definition of Fiscal Year": "A fiscal year is an accounting year that does not end on December 31. (Accounting years of January 1 through December 31 are known as calendar years.) A fiscal year could be a 12-month period of time or a 52/53-week period of time. One reason a U.S. business or other organization will have its accounting year end on a date other than December 31 is to coincide with its natural business year. When an organization’s fiscal year ends outside of the CPAs’ busy season, the organization may be able to negotiate a lower auditing fee.",
    "Examples of Fiscal Years": "A few examples of fiscal years include:",
    "Examples of a General Ledger": "In a manual accounting or bookkeeping system, the general ledger is a “book” with a separate page or ledger sheet for each account. (When a significant amount of detailed information is needed for an account such as Accounts Receivable, a subsidiary ledger is often used.) In a computerized system, the general ledger will be an electronic file of all the needed accounts. This also facilitates the electronic preparation of the company’s financial statements.",
    "Example of Recording an Asset that was Partially Financed": "Assume that your company purchased a car for $10,000 by paying cash of $4,000 and signing a promissory note for $6,000. The accounting entry is:",
    "Definition of Unpresented Cheque or Check": "An unpresented cheque is a check that a company has written, but the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. An unpresented check is also referred to as an outstanding check or a check that has not yet cleared the bank. In the bank reconciliation, the unpresented or outstanding check is deducted from the balance per the bank in order to arrive at the adjusted or corrected balance per bank.",
    "Effect of Unpresented Check on Balance Sheet": "When a company writes a check, the company records it with a credit to the Cash account in the company’s general ledger. Whether the check has or hasn’t cleared the bank account, the company’s Cash account balance is proper. Hence, the company’s general ledger Cash account will not require an adjustment for the unpresented or outstanding check when it is reported on the balance sheet. ",
    "Amount Reported as Bad Debts Expense": "The amount reported in the income statement account Bad Debts Expense pertains to the estimated losses from extending credit during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. The estimated amount of Bad Debts Expense could be based on:",
    "Amount Reported as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts": "The balance reported in the balance sheet account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the estimated amount of Accounts Receivable that will not be collected. The balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts could be based upon:",
    "Example of Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts": "To illustrate, let’s assume that on December 31 a company had $100,000 in Accounts Receivable and its balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was a credit balance of $3,000. As a result, the December 31 balance sheet will be reporting that $97,000 will be turning to cash. During the first 30 days of January the company does not have any other information on bad accounts receivable. However, on January 31 the company learns that an additional $1,000 of its accounts receivable may not be collected. Therefore, on January 31 the company will make an adjusting entry to debit Bad Debts Expense for $1,000 and to credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $1,000. After this entry is recorded, the company’s income statement for the month of January will report Bad Debts Expense of $1,000 and its January 31 balance sheet will report a credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $4,000.",
    "Definition of Interest Unpaid on Note Payable": "Interest that has occurred, but has not been paid as of a balance sheet date, is referred to as accrued interest. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount that has occurred but is unpaid should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to the current liability Interest Payable.",
    "Example of Recording Unpaid Interest": "Let’s assume that on December 10, a company made its monthly payment on a loan and the payment included interest through December 10. On the company’s financial statements dated December 31, the company will need to report the interest expense and liability for December 11 through 31. This is done with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31. If the interest for December 11 through December 31 was $100, the adjusting entry dated December 31 will debit Interest Expense for $100, and will credit Interest Payable for $100.  ",
    "How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet": "An expense will decrease a corporation’s retained earnings (which is part of stockholders’ equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor’s capital account (which is part of owner’s equity). In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner’s capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:",
    "Definition of Window Dressing": "Window dressing refers to actions taken or not taken prior to issuing financial statements in order to improve the appearance of the financial statements.",
    "Example of Window Dressing": "Let’s assume that a company operates throughout the year with a negative balance in its general ledger account Cash: Checking Account. (At the bank, the checking account has a positive balance due to the time it takes for the company’s checks to clear.) In order to avoid its December 31 balance sheet reporting a negative cash balance, the company decides to postpone issuing checks for vendors’ invoices that should have been paid. The postponement allows its general ledger Cash account to temporarily have a positive amount. On January 2, the company will issue the postponed checks and will resume its normal practice of having a negative balance in its Cash account.",
    "Definition of Historical Cost": "Historical cost is the original cost of an asset including all the necessary costs to get the asset in place and ready for use. “Historical” means the cost is not adjusted for inflation or for changes in the current value or replacement value of the asset. For buildings, equipment, fixtures, vehicles, and other long-lived tangible assets other than land, the asset’s historical cost (minus its salvage value) is depreciated over the asset’s useful life and is recorded in a contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation. The balance in Accumulated Depreciation is reported on the balance sheet as a separate deduction from the assets’ historical costs. ",
    "Example of Historical Cost": "Let’s assume that a company purchased land in 1997 for $100,000. It continues to own the land and has not made any improvements. Today the land should be reported on the company’s balance sheet at its historical cost of $100,000 even though its current cost, replacement cost, inflation-adjusted cost, appraised value, and assessed value amounts range from $150,000 to $270,000.",
    "Definition of Payroll Accounting": "Payroll accounting involves a company’s recording of its employees’ compensation including:",
    "Example of Payroll Accounting": "If a company’s employees are paid weekly based on hours worked, the payroll processing is likely done during the first few days following the work week. If the company’s accounting periods are calendar months (and the calendar year), the company will have to accrue for the wages and benefits earned by the hourly paid employees (which are not yet paid or recorded in the general ledger accounts) as of the last day of each month. You can see more details including journal entries at our free Explanation of Payroll Accounting.",
    "Definition of Payroll Withholding Taxes": "In the U.S. payroll withholding taxes are the taxes that an employer is required to deduct from its employees’ gross wages, salaries, bonuses, and other compensation.",
    "Examples of Payroll Withholding Taxes": "The typical payroll withholding taxes include:",
    "Payroll Withholdings are Liabilities": "The payroll taxes withheld from employees are a current liability of the employer until the amounts are remitted to the governments.  (The taxes withheld from employees are not an expense of the company that withheld them.)  The payroll taxes that are not withheld from employees are expenses of the employer and are liabilities until the amounts are remitted. Examples include the employer’s portion of the FICA tax and unemployment taxes. ",
    "Definition of Net Income": "Net income is the positive result of a company’s revenues and gains minus  its expenses and losses. A negative result is referred to as net loss. (There are a few gains and losses which are not included in the calculation of net income. However, they are part of comprehensive income). Net income is also known as net earnings. The details of the net income calculation are reported in the business’s income statement. The net income of a regular U.S. corporation includes the income tax expense which pertains to the items reported in its income statement. The net income of a sole proprietorship, partnership, and Subchapter S corporation will not include income tax expense since the owners (not the entity) are responsible for the business’s income tax.",
    "Effect of Net Income on the Balance Sheet": "A corporation’s positive net income causes an increase in the retained earnings, which is part of stockholders’ equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in retained earnings and stockholders’ equity. A sole proprietorship’s net income will cause an increase in the owner’s capital account, which is part of owner’s equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in the owner’s capital account and owner’s equity.",
    "Definition of Accounting Period": "An accounting period is the period of time covered by a company’s financial statements. Common accounting periods for external financial statements include the calendar year (January 1 through December 31) and the calendar quarter (January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, October 1 through December 31). It is common for these companies to also have monthly accounting periods. However, the financial statements for the monthly accounting periods are likely to be used only by the companies’ managements. In the U.S., some companies have annual accounting periods that end on dates other than December 31. For example, a company could have a fiscal year of July 1 through the following June 30. Its quarterly accounting periods would be July 1 through September 30, etc. It is also common for U.S. retailers to have accounting periods that end on a Saturday. The annual accounting period for these businesses may be the 52- or 53-week fiscal years ending on the Saturday closest to February 1 or any other date. The retailers’ quarterly accounting periods will be the 13-week periods, and the monthly accounting periods will be a 4- or 5-week time period. ",
    "Examples of Accounting Periods": "The following are some examples of accounting periods used by U.S. companies:",
    "Definition of Long-term Asset": "A long-term asset is an asset that is not expected to be converted to cash or be consumed within one year of the date shown in the heading of the balance sheet. (If a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, a long-term asset is not expected to turn to cash within the operating cycle.) Expressed another way, a long-term asset is an asset that does not meet the criteria of being reported as a current asset. Hence, long-term assets are also known as noncurrent assets or long-lived assets. ",
    "Examples of Long-term Assets": "Long-term assets include long-term investments in financial securities, property, plant, equipment, and intangible assets.",
    "Definition of Accrued Income": "Accrued income is an amount that:",
    "Example of Accrued Income": "One example of accrued income is the interest a company earns on a bond investment. To illustrate, let’s assume that a company invested $100,000 on December 1 in a 6% $100,000 bond that pays $3,000 of interest on each June 1 and December 1. On December 31, the company will have earned one month’s interest amounting to $500 ($100,000 x 6% per year x 1/12 of a year, or 1/6 of the semiannual $3,000). No interest will be received in December since it will be included in the $3,000 interest that will be received on June 1. The $500 of interest that has been earned during December, but not yet received nor previously recorded as of December 31, is accrued interest income. The accrued interest income will be recorded with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) for $500, and credits Interest Income (an income statement account) for $500.",
    "Examples of Debits Increasing Assets and Expenses": "To illustrate that debits increase asset account balances, assume that Jim starts a new business by depositing $20,000 of his personal savings into the business checking account. The business asset Cash is increased with a debit of $20,000 and the Owner’s Equity account is increased with a credit of $20,000. Next, the business buys office equipment for $4,000. Since the asset account Office Equipment must be increased a debit of $4,000 is recorded. Since the asset Cash must be decreased a credit of $4,000 is recorded. To illustrate that debits increase the balances in expense accounts, assume that Jim’s business pays $600 to rent office space for the current month. The asset account Cash will be credited $600 since this asset’s account balance must be decreased. Therefore, the second part of the entry will have to be a debit. In this transaction the account Rent Expense will be debited for $600. (Recall that expenses must be debited because the credit balance in Owner’s Equity must be decreased.)",
    "Definition of Advertising Expense": "Advertising is the amount a company incurs to promote its products, brands, and image via television, radio, magazines, Internet, etc. Since the accountants cannot measure the future benefit of the advertising, the advertising costs must be reported as Advertising Expense at the time the ads are run. A prepayment of the cost of ads that will air in the future should be recorded in a current asset account such as Prepaid Advertising. When the ad is aired, the amount must be transferred from Prepaid Advertising to Advertising Expense.",
    "Example of Advertising as an Asset and as an Expense": "Let’s assume that in December a corporation paid $15 million to prepare an ad and to book a time for it to be shown during the Super Bowl Game in early February. Until February, the $15 million is the current asset Prepaid Advertising. After the ad is shown in the Super Bowl Game, the corporation must credit Prepaid Advertising and debit Advertising Expense. This is necessary because the accountants cannot measure the sales (if any) that will occur because of the Super Bowl ad.",
    "Definition of an Invoice": "An invoice received from a vendor is a billing for goods or services that it had provided. The vendor’s invoice will include the quantities of the items provided, brief descriptions, unit prices, amount due, credit terms, where to remit payment, etc.",
    "Definition of a Statement": "A statement from a supplier lists the amounts from past invoices that the customer has not paid. For example, the statement from a supplier might indicate that as of July 31 the customer owes the entire amounts from four invoices and a small amount from a fifth invoice. However, it is possible that the statement amount is not the current amount owed. For instance, it is possible that on July 30 and on August 3 the customer had paid the amounts owed for two of the invoices listed on the statement. For this reason, companies are wise to have the policy to make payments only from invoices and never from statements. The purpose of this policy is to avoid paying a supplier’s invoice twice.",
    "Definition of Prepaid Expense": "A prepaid expense refers to an amount that a company has paid and a portion or all of it will be an expense in a later accounting period.",
    "Example of a Prepaid Expense": "A company with an accounting year ending on December 31 has a prepaid expense if on December 1, it paid $6,000 for insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31.",
    "Recording a Prepaid Expense": "A prepaid expense can be recorded initially as an expense or as a current asset. Either way, adjusting entries will be needed during the six months to be certain that:",
    "Definition of Negative Owner’s Equity": "Negative owner’s equity means the amount of a sole proprietorship’s liabilities exceeds the amount of its assets.  ",
    "Example of Negative Owner’s Equity": "Let’s assume that an owner invests $100,000 to begin a new sole proprietorship business. At this point, the owner’s equity is a positive $100,000. During the first year of operations, the business’s expenses exceeded revenues by $108,000 and there were no draws or additional investments by the owner. The owner’s equity at the end of the first year will be a negative $8,000. The negative amount of owner’s equity is a problem that will be obvious to anyone reading the company’s balance sheet. However, the company may be able to operate if its cash inflows are greater and sooner than the cash outflows necessary for meeting its payments on its liabilities. ",
    "Definition of Replenishing Petty Cash": "Replenishing the petty cash fund means the petty cash custodian requests and receives cash from the company’s regular checking account in an amount that will return the cash on hand to the amount shown in the general ledger account Petty Cash.",
    "Example of Replenishing Petty Cash": "Let’s assume that a company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash has a debit balance of $100. Mary is the petty cash custodian who is the only person handling the petty cash transactions. At all times Mary should have some combination of cash and petty cash vouchers (receipts) that are equal to $100. Next, let’s assume that there is only $20.00 in cash remaining and Mary realizes that $20 is not sufficient. She needs to obtain a company check for $80 in order to cash it and return the cash amount to $100 (the amount shown in the Petty Cash account). The petty cash vouchers provide the documentation for the $80 check request. In the process Mary discovers that the vouchers add up to only $79. Mary will debit the accounts indicated on the petty cash vouchers and then debit Cash Short and Over for $1 (the amount that is not accounted for).  It is important to realize that the $80 check will be credited to Cash (the company’s checking account). There is no entry to the  Petty Cash account when merely replenishing the petty cash.",
    "Definition of Inventory is Understated": "If inventory is understated at the end of the year, it means that the amount of inventory being reported is less than the true or correct amount. Some reasons for reporting too little ending inventory could be any or all of the following:",
    "Example of Understated Inventory": "The formula for the cost of goods sold is:\nCost of beginning inventory + cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available – cost of ending inventory = cost of goods sold. Assume that the cost of goods available for the year 2023 was $240,000. If the company shows too little of that cost as its ending inventory (say $15,000 instead of $25,000), it will mean that too much cost will appear on the 2023 income statement as the cost of goods sold ($225,000 instead of $215,000). The formula for the gross profit is: Net sales – cost of goods sold = gross profit. If net sales for 2023 were $300,000, the gross profit will be incorrectly reported as $75,000 ($300,000 – $225,000) instead of the true amount of $85,000 ($300,000 – $215,000). In 2024, the amount of the beginning inventory is the amount reported as the ending inventory of 2023  ($15,000 instead of $25,000). If the net purchases during 2024 are $270,000, the cost of goods available will be $285,000 (instead of $295,000). After subtracting the 2024 ending inventory of $30,000, the cost of goods sold will be $255,000 (instead of $265,000). This means that the cost of goods sold for 2024 will be too low by $10,000. If net sales are $325,000, the gross profit will be $70,000 ($325,000 – $255,000) instead of $60,000 ($325,000 – $265,000). This means the gross profit will too low. Recap: the gross profit in 2023 was understated by $10,000 ($75,000 instead of the true $85,000). The gross profit in 2024 was overstated by $10,000 ($70,000 instead of the true $60,000). One error in calculating the ending inventory of 2023 caused the individual income statements of 2023 and 2024 to report incorrect gross profits and incorrect net incomes. (In our example, only the balance sheet for December 31, 2023 reported the incorrect amounts of inventory and owner’s equity.)",
    "Definition of Current Liabilities": "Current liabilities (also known as short-term liabilities) for most companies are the obligations that must be paid within one one year of the balance sheet date or will create another current liability. (For companies with operating cycles greater than one year, their current liabilities are the obligations due within the operating cycle.)",
    "Typical Current Liabilities": "Some common examples of current liabilities that are reported on a company’s balance sheet include the following: Accounts payable which are the amounts owed to vendors who have supplied goods or services. The amount of accounts payable is documented by the vendor invoices that have been approved and processed, but have not yet been paid. Deferred revenues which are the amounts that a customer has prepaid and will be earned by the company within one year of the balance sheet date. An example is a retailer’s unredeemed gift cards. Accrued compensation which includes a company’s obligations related to employees working for the company.  Other accrued expenses or liabilities which includes amounts owed and not reported as accounts payable or accrued compensation. Examples include the interest expense that the company has incurred (but has not yet paid) and repairs that took place but the vendor’s invoice has not been processed. Short-term notes which include loans from banks and other lenders that come due within one year of the balance sheet date. Current portion of long-term debt which includes the principal payments of a mortgage loan or other long-term loans that must be paid within one year of the date of the balance sheet. There is no requirement that the current liabilities be presented in the order in which they will be paid. As a result, a loan that is due in 11 months might be listed first even though other obligations will be due within one month.",
    "Definition of Financial Statement": "Generally, the term financial statement could be referring to:",
    "Examples of Financial Statements": "The external financial statements issued by U.S. corporations should include all of the following:",
    "Definition of Revenues": "A company’s revenues are amounts it has earned as the result of business activities such as selling merchandise or performing services. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which they are earned even though the dependable customers will pay the company 30 days later.",
    "Example of Revenues": "On June 10, a company sells $4,000 of goods to one of its best customers with credit terms of net 30 days. On June 10, the company has revenues of $4,000 which will be recorded with a debit of $4,000 to Accounts Receivable and a credit of $4,000 to Sales Revenues.   ",
    "Definition of Receipts": "A company’s receipts  refers to the cash that the company received.",
    "Examples of Receipts": "The following are some examples of receipts which are not revenues:",
    "Example of Both a Revenue and a Receipt": "When a company makes a $200 cash sale (or performs services for $200 of cash) the company has earned revenue of $200 and has a receipt of $200.",
    "Example of General Journal and General Ledger": "Assume that a company depreciates its equipment at a rate of $10,000 per year. In the general journal the company enters the following information:",
    "Definition of Paid-in Capital": "Paid-in capital is one of the major categories of stockholders’ equity. Generally, paid-in capital reports the amount that a corporation received from its stockholders (or shareholders) in exchange for the newly issued shares of its capital stock.  Paid-in capital is also referred to as contributed capital and as permanent capital.",
    "Definition of Retained Earnings": "Retained earnings is one component of the stockholders’ equity section of a corporation’s balance sheet. Some refer to retained earnings as reinvested earnings since this part of the corporation’s cumulative earnings have not been distributed to the corporation’s stockholders in the form of cash dividends.",
    "Fixed Assets are Part of Noncurrent Assets": "Fixed assets are one of several categories of noncurrent assets. Fixed assets are usually reported on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment. Noncurrent or long-term assets consist of the following:",
    "Definition of Net Cash Flow": "Net cash flow is the combination of the cash received and the cash disbursed. In other words, it is the combination of the debit amounts coming into a company’s Cash account and the credit amounts going out of the Cash account.",
    "Examples of Net Cash Flows": "The net cash flows include the cash inflows such as the money received from customers who purchased products on credit in an earlier accounting period, cash sales occurring in the current accounting period, money received from a bank loan, money received from disposing of an old asset, etc.  The net cash flows also include the cash outflows such as paying for new equipment, paying for goods and services from the last accounting period, repaying bank loans, making a temporary investment, etc. ",
    "Example of Net Income": "Assume ABCO Consulting Company earns $100,000 in mid-December but allows the customer to pay in January. ABCO’s net income is increased in December, but its Cash account will not increase until January. Next assume that ABCO acquires extensive electronic equipment in December for a cash payment of $40,000 and depreciates the equipment’s cost over 5 years. In December, ABCO will have very little depreciation expense, which means a small reduction in its December’s net income. However, ABCO’s Cash account will be reduced by $40,000 in December.",
    "Reconciling Net Cash Flow vs. Net Income": "As a result of the difference between a company’s net income and the change in a company’s cash balance, the statement of cash flows is required to be issued along with the income statement and the other required financial statements.",
    "Definition of Par Value Stock": "Some states’ laws require or may have required common stock issued by corporations residing in their states to have a par value. If a par value is required, the corporation will likely assign a very small amount per share of common stock. The par value is also referred to as the corporation’s legal capital. On the other hand, if a corporation issues preferred stock, this stock’s par value is meaningful since its dividends are expressed as a percentage of the preferred stock’s par value.",
    "Examples of Stock with Par Values": "If a corporation’s common stock has a par value, the par value of an issued share of common stock must be recorded in an account separate from the amount received over and above the amount of par value. For example, if a corporation issues 100 new shares of its common stock for a total of $2,000 and the stock’s par value is $1 per share, the accounting entry is a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock—Par $100, and a credit to Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par for $1,900. In total the Cash account increased by $2,000 and the paid-in capital reported under stockholders’ equity increased by a total of $2,000 ($100 + $1,900). If a corporation issues 500 shares of 5% preferred stock with a par value of $100 per share and receives $50,000, the entry will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit 5% Preferred Stock for $50,000. The corporation agrees to pay the preferred stockholders dividends of $2,500 (par value of $50,000 X 5%) each year.",
    "Example of Stock with No Par Value": "If a corporation is not required to have a par value (or a stated value) for its common stock and the corporation issues 100 shares for $2,000, the accounting entry will debit Cash for $2,000 and will credit Common Stock for $2,000.",
    "Purchases Account Under the Periodic Inventory System": "The general ledger account Purchases is used to record the purchases of inventory items under the periodic inventory system. Under the periodic system the account Inventory will have no entries until it is adjusted at the end of the accounting year so that it reports the cost of the ending inventory. Under the periodic system, the cost in the account Purchases will be added to the cost of the beginning inventory to arrive at the cost of goods available. The cost of the ending inventory is computed through a physical count (or an estimate) and is subtracted from the cost of goods available to arrive at the cost of goods sold.",
    "Inventory Account Under the Perpetual Inventory System": "The account Purchases is nonexistent with the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the cost of inventory items purchased are recorded directly into the account Inventory. Under the perpetual system, the costs of the goods sold are removed from the account Inventory when the goods are sold and are recorded in the account Cost of Goods Sold. As a result, the balance in the account Inventory should be the cost of the ending inventory.",
    "Definition of Liability Account": "A liability account is a general ledger account in which a company records the following which resulted from business transactions:",
    "Examples of Liability Accounts": "Common liability accounts used with the accrual method of accounting include:",
    "Ways to Record One-Year Subscriptions": "Let’s assume that the cost of the one-year subscription for a monthly trade publication is $120. Let’s also assume the payment is made at the start of the subscription period, and that your company prepares monthly financial statements. One way to enter the transaction is to debit the current asset Prepaid Subscriptions for $120 and to credit Cash for $120. At the end of each month an adjusting entry would be prepared to debit Subscriptions Expense for $10 and to credit Prepaid Subscriptions for $10. This approach would obviously match the annual cost to each of the 12 monthly periods benefiting from the subscription. However, this is not practical given the small amount involved. Thanks to the accounting concept of materiality, accountants can ignore the matching principle when the amount is insignificant in relationship to the company’s size. Since no investor or lender would be misled if the entire $120 appeared as an expense in one month and $0 appeared in the other 11 months, the following entry would be more practical: debit Subscriptions Expense for $120 and credit Cash for $120 at the time of entering the invoice into the accounting records. If an annual trade group membership fee is $6,000 and the amount is significant for the company, the company should record the payment as a prepaid asset and then write a monthly adjusting entry for $500.",
    "Reasons for Monthly Accruals": "Accrual adjusting entries are needed monthly only if a company issues monthly financial statements. Two reasons for the monthly accrual adjusting entries are:",
    "Profit’s Effect on the Balance Sheet": "The profit or net income belongs to the owner of a sole proprietorship or to the stockholders of a corporation. If a company prepares its balance sheet in the account form, it means that the assets are presented on the left side or debit side. The liabilities and owner’s equity (or stockholders’ equity) are presented on the right side or credit side. Recall that the balance sheet reflects the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.",
    "Example of Profit’s Effect on the Balance Sheet": "Assume that you own and operate a sole proprietorship. You provided a service to a client and earned revenues of $900 and had no expenses. One of the business assets (cash or accounts receivable) increased and the liabilities did not change. As a result, the owner’s equity (the owner’s capital account) increases. Accountants do prepare an income statement or P&L to report the revenues and expenses, but the ultimate effect of a positive amount of profit or net income is to increase the business’s assets and owner’s equity.",
    "Definition of Sole Proprietorship Drawing Account": "The drawing or withdrawal account for a sole proprietorship is a temporary owner equity’s account that is closed at the end of the accounting year. The drawing account is also a contra account to owner’s equity, because the drawing account’s debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance for an owner’s equity account. At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed directly to the capital account with an entry that debits the owner’s capital account and credits the owner’s drawing account. Please note that the owner’s drawing account is not an expense and as a result it does not get closed to the Income Summary account nor will the amount appear on the company’s income statement.",
    "Example of the Entry to Close the Drawing Account": "Let’s assume that at the end of the accounting year the account Eve Jones, Drawing has a debit balance of $24,000. This balance is the result of Eve withdrawing $2,000 per month from her sole proprietorship for her personal use. (The monthly withdrawals were recorded with a debit to Eve Jones, Drawing and a credit to Cash.) The journal entry to close the drawing account at the end of the accounting year will credit Eve Jones, Drawing for $24,000 and will debit Eve Jones, Capital for $24,000.",
    "Definition of Inventoriable Costs": "Inventoriable costs are:",
    "Examples of Inventoriable Costs": "Assume that a retailer purchases an item for resale by paying $20 to the supplier. The item is purchased FOB shipping point, which means that the retailer must pay the freight from the supplier to its location. If the freight cost is $1, then the retailer’s inventoriable cost of the item is $21. [If this is the only item in the retailer’s inventory, the retailer’s balance sheet will report inventory at a cost of $21. When the item is sold, the retailer’s inventory will decrease by $21, and the $21 will be reported on its income statement as the cost of goods sold.] In the case of a manufacturer, assume one of its product’s required the following costs: direct materials of $6, direct labor of $4, and manufacturing overhead of $7. This manufacturer’s inventoriable cost (or product cost) is $17. The $17 will be part of the manufacturer’s inventory until it is sold. When it is sold, the $17 will be removed from inventory and will become part of the manufacturer’s cost of goods sold.",
    "Examples of Balance Sheet Elements": "Assets that are reported on the balance sheet are the company’s resources such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, investments, land, buildings, equipment, some intangible assets . Generally assets are reported at their cost or a lower amount due to the cost principle, depreciation, and conservatism. The cost principle also means that some very valuable aspects of the company are not listed as assets. For example, a company’s outstanding reputation, its effective management team, and its amazing brand recognition are not reported as assets if they were not acquired in a transaction involving another party or entity. Liabilities are a company’s obligations as of the balance sheet date and will include loans payable, accounts payable, accrued expenses not yet recorded in accounts payable, warranty obligations, taxes payable, and more. Stockholders’ equity or owner’s equity reports the amounts that were invested by the owners plus the company’s earnings that the owners chose not to withdraw as dividends or drawings.",
    "Additional Balance Sheet Information": "The balance sheet classifications allow the reader to easily compute the amount of a company’s working capital and to determine if a company is highly leveraged. Every balance sheet that is distributed by a company should include notes (or footnote disclosures). These notes provide important additional information concerning the company’s financial position including potential liabilities not included in the amounts reported on the face of the balance sheet.",
    "Definition of Debits and Credits": "Debits and credits are terms used in accounting and bookkeeping systems for the past five centuries. They are part of the double entry system which results in every business transaction affecting at least two accounts. At least one of the accounts will receive a debit entry and at least one other account will receive a credit entry. Further, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits. You should think of a debit as an entry on the left side of an account, and a credit as an entry on the right side of another account. Accountants often use T-accounts to visualize the debit and credit effects on the accounts’ balances. It may take some time to learn which general ledger accounts will be debited and credited, but here are some general rules:",
    "Examples of Debits and Credits": "To illustrate, let’s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company will enter $10,000 as a debit in its Cash account and a credit of $10,000 in its Notes Payable account. If the company pays $300 for an ad to air on the radio, the company will enter $300 as a debit in the Advertising Expense account and will enter $300 as a credit in its Cash account.",
    "How a Rent Payment Affects the Accounting Equation": "A company’s payment of each month’s rent reduces the company’s asset Cash. This is recorded with a credit to Cash. If the payment is for the current month’s rent, the second account is to the temporary account Rent Expense which will be debited. The debit to Rent Expense also causes owner’s equity (or stockholders’ equity) to decrease. Eventually, the balances in the company’s temporary accounts will actually be transferred/closed to the owner’s capital account (or to a corporation’s retained earnings account within stockholders’ equity). To recap the above, the monthly rent payment keeps the sole proprietor’s accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity, in balance because it reduces the company’s assets and it reduces the company’s owner’s equity.",
    "Definition of Sales Commissions": "Sales commissions are amounts earned by selling another company’s goods or services and paid by the company whose goods or services were sold. The amounts earned/paid are often based on dollars of sales or number of units sold. The company responsible for paying the sales commissions will report a selling expense. It will also report a liability for any unpaid commissions. The company or person that did the selling will report revenues or income for the amount earned. It will also report a receivable for any commissions earned but not yet received.",
    "Examples of Sales Commission": "Under the accrual basis of accounting (as opposed to the cash basis) the parties involved should record the sales commissions as follows:",
    "Accounting Entry When Signing a Contract": "Merely signing a contract does not by itself require a journal entry. In other words, signing a contract for a future transaction does not mean the company is increasing or decreasing an asset or a liability at the time of the signing. Of course, if cash or some other asset is exchanged at the time of the signing, it will have to be recorded. While a journal entry is not required at the time the contract is signed, significant commitments that are contained in the contract must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the parties to a noncancelable contract.",
    "Examples of No Entry When Signing a Contract": "Assume that an electric utility signs a noncancelable contract with a coal company to purchase 100 million tons of coal to be delivered over a one-year period that will begin in three months. On the day the contract is signed, the electric utility does not own any of the coal specified in the contract, nor does it owe for any of the coal, since the coal will not be delivered for at least three months. When the first trainload of coal arrives at the electric utility at least three months later, the utility will record the purchase of only the coal that has arrived and the related account payable. Likewise, on the day the contract is signed, the coal company does not have a sale of the coal specified in the contract, and it does not have a receivable from the electric utility. Three months later, when the first shipment of coal is delivered to the utility, the coal company will record a sale of the coal and a related account receivable. If the commitments made by the utility and the coal company are significant, those commitments must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of both the utility and the coal company.  ",
    "Definition of Elements of Financial Statements": "The elements of financial statements are the classes of items contained in the financial statements. ",
    "Examples of Elements of Financial Statements": "The elements of the financial statements include:",
    "Definition of Revenues and Earnings": "Revenues are the amounts earned from providing goods or services to customers during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. Revenues are the amounts earned before deducting expenses (cost of goods sold, SG&A) and losses. Revenues are sometimes referred to as the top line amount on a company’s income statement. Earnings  or net income are often referred to as the bottom line amount on the income statement, since it is the remainder after subtracting the cost of goods sold, SG&A, non-operating expenses, and losses from the revenues (both operating revenues and nonoperating revenues and gains). When a corporation’s stock is publicly-traded, the amount of earnings must also be shown on the income statement as earnings per share (EPS) of common stock.",
    "Example of Revenues and Earnings": "Assume that for the most recent year a corporation had net sales of $410,000; cost of goods sold $230,000; SG&A $120,000; interest expense $10,000; income tax expense $9,000. For the recent year the corporation’s revenues were $410,000 and its earnings were $41,000.",
    "Why Rent Expense is a Debit": "Rent expense (and any other expense) will reduce a company’s owner’s equity (or stockholders’ equity). Owner’s equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to reduce the credit balance, the expense accounts will require debit entries.",
    "Example of Rent Expense as a Debit": "If a company pays $800 for the current month’s rent, the company’s assets and its owner’s equity will decrease. To decrease an asset such as Cash, the company will credit the Cash account for $800. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, the company will need to debit another account for $800. In this case, the account is Rent Expense. (Eventually the debit balance in the Rent Expense account will be transferred/closed to the proprietor’s capital account or to a corporation’s retained earnings account.)",
    "Why Service Revenues is a Credit": "Service revenues (and any other revenues) will increase a company’s owner’s equity (or stockholders’ equity). Owner’s equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to increase the credit balance, the revenues accounts will have to be credited.",
    "Example of Service Revenues as a Credit": "If the company earns and receives $300 for providing a service, the company’s assets and owner’s equity will increase. The asset Cash will be increased with a debit of $300. Therefore, another account will need to be credited. In this case Service Revenues will be credited for $300. Service Revenues is a temporary account that will eventually be closed to the owner’s equity account.",
    "Definition of Accrued Revenues": "Accrued revenues include service revenues, interest income, sales of goods, etc. which have been earned by a business, but the transactions are not yet fully processed and therefore are not recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts. If it is the end of the accounting period, these amounts must be recorded to comply with the accrual method of accounting. By entering these on an adjusting entry dated for the last day of the accounting period, the amounts will be included on the period’s financial statements.",
    "Example of Recording Accrued Revenues": "Assume your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The loan agreement specifies that the $100,000 is to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, your company has not billed the supplier for the interest since it is not due until February 28. However, as of December 31, your company has earned $1,000 of interest (1/3 of $3,000). For the December financial statements to report the amount earned, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and credits $1,000 to Interest Income (an income statement account).",
    "Order for Listing Liabilities": "It is logical for a company’s liabilities to be organized in the chart of accounts in the same way as they are presented on the balance sheet:",
    "Order for Listing Current Liabilities": "Within the current liabilities classification, the order in which the current liability accounts are listed can vary. Here is a summary of how they might be organized:",
    "Definition of Profit": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, profit is the amount of revenues earned minus the amount of expenses incurred.  Note that revenues are not receipts, and expenses are not payments.",
    "How Profits Change the Balance Sheet": "Since all business transactions affect at least two accounts, there will likely be an enormous number of changes to the balance sheet. Here are some of the changes:",
    "Definition of Closing Entries": "Closing entries occur at the end of an accounting year to transfer the balances in the temporary accounts to a permanent or real account. The intended result is for each temporary account to begin the next accounting year with a zero balance. The temporary accounts include the income statement accounts (revenue, expense, gain, loss, income summary) and also the drawing account of a sole proprietorship. The balances in these accounts will ultimately end up in the sole proprietor’s capital account or the corporation’s retained earnings account.",
    "Accounts that are Debited in the Closing Entries": "The following temporary accounts normally have credit balances that require a debit as part of the closing entries:",
    "Definition of Classified Balance Sheet": "A classified balance sheet arranges the amounts from a company’s balance sheet accounts into a format that is useful for the readers. For instance, the reader can easily calculate the company’s working capital since the classified balance sheet shows the total amount of the company’s current assets and the total amount of its current liabilities. A classified balance sheet is likely used by companies and is organized as follows:",
    "Example of Classified Balance Sheet": "A condensed version of a classified balance sheet is shown here: ",
    "Examples of Profit Without Cash": "Assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. In its first month of operations, it provides $10,000 of services to its clients and allows them to pay 30 days later. It also incurs $2,000 of expenses of which it pays $1,100 immediately and will pay $900 in 30 days. In its first month, the company had a profit of $8,000 (revenues of $10,000 minus $2,000 of expenses), but its cash decreased by $1,100 (cash receipts of $0 with cash payments of $1,100). If it has no other business transactions, the company’s profit in the second month will be $0 (no revenues minus no expenses) but it will have a $9,100 increase in cash (receipts of $10,000 minus payments of $900). Now assume that a different company had a profit of $60,000 in its first year, but paid out $65,000 near the end of the year to acquire equipment that will be put into service on the first day of its second year. During its first year the company had $65,000 of profit, but may end the year with $0 cash. Other examples where cash is paid out, but the profits are not reduced at the time of the payment, include prepayments of insurance premiums, payments to increase its inventory of merchandise, and payments to reduce liabilities. To help recognize the difference between a company’s profits and its cash flows, the statement of cash flows is one of the required external financial statements.",
    "Definition of Rent Receivable": "Rent Receivable is an asset account in the general ledger of a landlord which reports the amount of rent that has been earned but not received as of the date of the balance sheet.",
    "Definition of Rent Revenue": "Rent Revenue is the title of an income statement account which (under the accrual basis of accounting) indicates the amount of rent that has been earned during the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. The account Rent Revenue is also known as Rental Income.",
    "Definition of Direct Write Off Method": "Under the direct write off method of accounting for credit losses pertaining to accounts receivable, no bad debts expense is reported on the income statement until an account receivable is actually removed from the company’s receivables. Under the direct write off method there is no contra asset account such as  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This means that the balance sheet is reporting the full amount of accounts receivable and therefore implying that the full amount will be converted to cash.",
    "Reason Why the Direct Write Off Method is Not Preferred": "The accounting profession does not prefer the direct method for the following reasons:",
    "Definition of Stock": "Shares of common stock are ownership interests in a corporation. There is no promise to pay dividends nor is there a maturity date. The dividends (if any are paid) do not reduce earnings nor do they reduce the corporation’s taxable income.  ",
    "Examples of Stock": "The following are examples of the two meanings of stock:",
    "Definition of Periodicity": "Periodicity is an accounting assumption made by accountants so that a company’s complex and ongoing activities can be divided up into annual, quarterly, and monthly amounts that will be reported on the respective financial statements. Periodicity allows companies to report meaningful financial statements covering relatively short periods of time. Periodicity is also known as the time period assumption. ",
    "Examples of the Periodicity Assumption": "An earth-moving equipment manufacturer may require two years to build a special machine for one of its customers. Periodicity allows the manufacturer to divide the manufacturing costs of the machine into the 24 monthly periods covered by the contract. Periodicity also allows the manufacturer to report the revenues and net income it earned in each of the months during the two-year contract.",
    "Definition of Sales": "In accounting, the term sales refers to the revenues earned when a company sells its goods, products, merchandise, etc.  When a company sells a noncurrent asset that had been used in its business (old delivery truck, display counters, company car, etc.), the amount received is not recorded as a sale. (Instead, the company will report this transaction on its income statement as a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset.)",
    "Example of Sales": "The amounts recorded at the time of the sales transactions are known as gross sales. The gross sales minus subtractions for sales returns, sales allowances, and early payment discounts is known as net sales.) Under the accrual basis or accrual method of accounting, goods sold on credit are reported as sales (revenue) when the goods have been transferred to the buyer. Usually this occurs before the seller receives payment from the buyer. The sales on credit are recorded with a debit to Accounts Receivable and a credit to Sales.",
    "Definition of Estimating Uncollectible Accounts Receivable": "When a company sells goods and/or provides services on account (on credit) using the accrual basis or method of accounting, the amount of the sales or service revenues is reported on the income statement and the related accounts receivable is reported on the balance sheet (until the receivables are collected). Unfortunately, some customers may not pay the amount owed to the company. In order to not overstate the company’s profits and current assets, the following is required:",
    "Examples of Estimating Uncollectible Accounts Receivable": "Two common ways of estimating the amount of uncollectible receivables are:",
    "Definition of Crossfoot or Crossfooting": "Accountants and auditors use the word foot to mean adding one or more columns of numbers. When there are several columns of numbers along with a “Total” column, they will crossfoot the totals. Crossfooting means to sum the total amounts appearing at the bottom of each column and verify that this “grand total” is equal to the total shown at the bottom of the “Total” column.",
    "Example of Crossfoot or Crossfooting": "We will use the table below to illustrate the meaning of crossfoot or crossfooting. Note that the table shows the hours that three employees spent working for three clients. The column for Adam has the sum of 121, Beth’s has 176, and Cindy’s has 66. An auditor will “foot” each of these columns as well as the “Total” column to verify that the detailed amounts appearing in each column add up to the each column’s sum (121, 176, 66, and 363). In addition to summing or footing each column’s detail, the auditor will crossfoot the totals of Adam’s, Beth’s, and Cindy’s columns to be certain that the sum of these three column totals is equal to the sum of the “Total” column. In the following table crossfooting means adding 121 + 176 + 66 to be certain that its total of 363 is equal to the total or sum of the “Total” column’s 363. ",
    "Definition of Accrual Method": "The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later.  The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later.  The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large corporations. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company’s assets, liabilities, equity, and a more accurate reporting of its revenues, expenses, and earnings during each accounting period.",
    "Example of the Accrual Method": "Assume that a company sells $48,000 of merchandise on May 15, but allows the customer to pay on June 15. On May 15, the company will credit its income statement account Sales and will debit its current asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays on June 15, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.) Assume the company had a $10,000 plumbing repair done on May 31 and is told the amount will be $10,000 but the bill will not be received until June 3 and payment will be due on June 13. On May 31, the company will debit Repairs and Maintenance Expense for $10,000 and will credit the liability account Accrued Expenses (or Accounts Payable). (On June 13, the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)",
    "Definition of Prepaid Insurance": "Generally, Prepaid Insurance is a current asset account that has a debit balance. The debit balance indicates the amount that remains prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet. As time passes, the debit balance decreases as adjusting entries credit the account Prepaid Insurance and debit Insurance Expense.",
    "Example of a Credit Balance in Prepaid Insurance": "Assume that a company’s annual premium on its liability insurance policy is $2,400 and is due on the first day of each year. Also assume that the company prepares monthly financial statements. When the $2,400 payment is made on January 1, the company debits Prepaid Insurance and credits Cash. It also sets up automatic monthly adjusting entries to debit Insurance Expense for $200 and to credit Prepaid Insurance for $200 on the last day of each month.  On July 1, the company receives a premium refund of $120 from the insurance company. The company records the refund with a debit to Cash and a credit to Prepaid Insurance. The recurring monthly adjusting entries are not changed. At December 31, the balance in Prepaid Insurance will be a credit balance of $120, consisting of the debit of $2,400 on January 1, the 12 monthly credits of $200 each, and the $120 credit on July 1. Prior to issuing the December 31 financial statements, the company must remove the $120 credit balance in Prepaid Insurance by debiting Prepaid Insurance and crediting Insurance Expense. Since adjusting entries involve a balance sheet account and an income statement account, it is wise to monitor the balances in both Prepaid Insurance and Insurance Expense throughout the year. The amount that has not yet expired should be the balance in Prepaid Insurance. The amount that has expired should be reported as Insurance Expense.",
    "Definition of Statement of Activities": "The statement of activities is one of the main financial statements issued by a nonprofit organization. It is prepared instead of the income statement issued by a for-profit business. The statement of activities focuses on the total organization (as opposed to focusing on specific funds within the organization) and reports the following:",
    "Example of Statement of Activities": "The following is an example of a nonprofit’s statement of activities. ",
    "Definition of ERP": "In accounting, ERP is the acronym for enterprise resource planning. ERP could be described as a database software package that supports all of a business’s processes and operations including manufacturing, marketing, financial, human resources, and so on. In other words, the goal of ERP is to have one integrated system for the entire company. The integration of all of a company’s information from all departments, processes, operations, etc. requires that an ERP system be very sophisticated. This in turn requires a company to commit considerable resources for planning, training, and implementing an ERP system.",
    "Examples of ERP": "Two of the suppliers or vendors of major ERP systems include SAP and Oracle.",
    "Definition of a Credit": "In bookkeeping and accounting, a credit likely refers to the amount entered on the right side of a general ledger account or to the right side of a T-account.  A credit could also be a verb that means the act of recording an amount on the right side of an account. When an account balance is on the right side of an account, we say the account has a credit balance. A credit entry in an asset account will reduce the account’s usual debit balance.  A credit entry in a revenue, liability, or owner’s equity account will increase the account’s normal credit balance. When a bank credits a company’s checking account, the bank’s liability account Customer Deposits is increased. However, the company must debit its Cash account to increase the company’s asset Cash. Credit can also refer to loans, such as line of credit, letter of credit, credit rating, and so on.",
    "Example of a Credit": "Assume that a company uses $4,000 to purchase office equipment. Since the company’s Cash balance is decreased, the company will credit the account Cash for $4,000 and will debit the asset Office Equipment account for $4,000. If a company issues a credit memo for $100 to one of its customers, the company will credit its current asset account Accounts Receivable for $100 and will debit a contra revenue account such as Sales Returns and Allowances.",
    "Definition of Unearned Revenue": "In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to money received prior to being earned. It is also referred to as deferred revenue.",
    "Example of Unearned Revenue": "Assume that ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2023 in exchange for promising to provide the client with services for the year January 1 through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023 the entire $24,000 is unearned. Therefore, ABC’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 must report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2024 ABC must move $2,000 each month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement. This deferring of revenue to the periods in which it is earned will often be recorded by using the liability account Deferred Revenues. The monthly entry for $2,000 is often described as a deferral adjusting entry.",
    "Definition of Unrecorded Revenue": "Unrecorded revenue implies that the revenue has been earned, but not yet recorded in a company’s accounting records.",
    "Example of Unrecorded Revenue": "It is common for an electric utility to provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers’ meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of expenses (cost of fuel and other operating expenses) without the related revenue being reported. Therefore, at each balance sheet date, the utility must accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an accurual adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",
    "Depreciation and the Statement of Cash Flows": "The florist’s statement of cash flows (using the indirect method) begins with the net income of $22,000. Next, the depreciation expense of $8,000 is shown as a positive amount and is added to the net income to arrive at $30,000, which equals the cash receipts of $100,000 minus cash expenses of $70,000. Depreciation expense was added to the net income because the depreciation expense had reduced net income but cash was not reduced. In other words, the positive $8,000 of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it is merely a needed adjustment to convert the accrual net income to the cash provided from the florist’s operating activities.    While the amount of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it does reduce a corporation’s taxable income. That in turn reduces a profitable corporation’s cash payments for income taxes (by the amount of the corporation’s income tax rate). The savings of income tax payments is equivalent to a source of cash.",
    "Example of Crediting Sales": "Recall that asset accounts normally have debit balances and the liability and stockholders’ equity accounts normally have credit balances. To confirm that crediting the Sales account is logical, think of a $100 cash sale. The asset account Cash is debited for $100 and therefore the Sales account will have to be credited for $100. Also the accounting equation will remain in balance because the asset Cash is increased $100 with a debit, and through the closing entries the owner’s or stockholders’ equity account will be increased with a credit of $100.",
    "Definition of Credit Balance": "A credit balance refers to the balance on the right side of a general ledger account or T-account.  Normally, the liability and owner’s (stockholders’) equity accounts have credit balances. In other words, their balances are on the right side of the accounts similar to their position in the accounting equation: assets = liabilities + owner’s equity. The revenue accounts (which are temporary accounts) also have credit balances because revenues cause the owner’s equity account balances to increase.  Contra asset accounts and contra expense accounts will also have credit balances.",
    "Example of Accounts Where Credit is Not the Normal Balance": "Accounts where a credit balance is NOT the normal balance include the following:",
    "Definition of Prepaid Insurance as a Short-term Asset": "Prepaid insurance is usually a short term or current asset because insurance premiums are rarely billed for periods greater than one year. Annual or semiannual insurance premiums are typical.  As the prepaid amount expires, the company will reduce the asset account Prepaid Insurance with a credit entry and will debit Insurance Expense. (If the company arranges for its insurance premiums to be paid monthly, it is possible to have no prepaid amount.)",
    "Definition of a Short-term or Current Asset": "For most industries, a company’s current assets are defined as cash and other assets that will turn to cash or will be used up or consumed within one year of the balance sheet date. If a company is in an industry where the operating cycle is longer than one year, the company’s current assets are cash and assets that will be converted to cash or be used up/consumed during the operating cycle.",
    "Example of Prepaid Insurance": "Assume that on December 1, a newly formed company pays $600 for insurance coverage for the six months ending on June 1. As of December 31, the company will report Insurance Expense of $100 and its current asset Prepaid Insurance will report $500. The prepaid amount informs the readers of the December 31 balance sheet that the company will not have to pay $500 in cash for insurance during the next five months.",
    "Definition of Expenses and Payments": "Under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are costs that have been used up or have been incurred in the process of earning revenues and/or operating a business.  A payment is a disbursement of money (usually in the form of a check or currency). Some payments are current period expenses (e.g. current month’s rent payment) but many payments are not expenses of the current period.",
    "Examples of Expenses and Payments": "The following are some examples of expenses that will not require a payment in the current accounting period:",
    "Definition of Inventory Cost": "Inventories are reported at cost, not at selling prices. A retailer’s inventory cost is the cost to purchase the items from a supplier plus any other costs to get the items to the retailer. A manufacturer’s inventory consists of the cost to produce the items (the costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead). Sometimes a company’s inventory cost has to be reduced to a lower amount known as the net realizable value (NRV).  Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is reduced to the NRV, the amount of the write down is reported as a loss on the income statement. (There are a few industries where it is acceptable to report the inventory at its net realizable value instead of at its cost.)",
    "Examples of Inventory Cost": "Assume that a retailer purchases 100 units of a product for $30 per unit. In addition, the retailer must pay a freight bill of $200 to get the products from the supplier to the retailer’s location. These products will be included in inventory at their cost of $3,200. A manufacturer produces a batch of 100 units of Product X23 by using the following costs: materials $600, direct labor $700, and manufacturing overhead $1,200. The 100 units of X23 will be included in inventory at their production cost of $2,500.  Since the unit cost of items purchased or produced may be increasing with inflation, the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory to become part of the cost of goods sold. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",
    "Abbreviation for Debit and Credit": "The abbreviation for debit is dr. and the abbreviation for credit is cr. Apparently the “dr.” is associated with the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago, rather than the word “debit” which we use today.",
    "Definition of Accrued Liabilities": "Accrued liabilities are usually expenses that have been incurred by a company as of the end of an accounting period, but the amounts have not yet been paid or recorded in the general ledger. Accrued liabilities are recorded at the end of the accounting period by means of  adjusting entries. The amounts for some accrued liabilities and their related expenses (or losses) may have to be estimated.",
    "Examples of Accrued Liabilities": "Some examples of accrued liabilities include the following:",
    "Definition of Valuing Inventory": "Generally, the financial statements of a U.S. company must report its inventory at its historical cost (not at its selling prices). Inventories are to be reported at less than the historical cost if the net realizable value of the inventories is lower than the cost. Companies should physically count their inventories at least once a year and the calculations reviewed carefully since the cost of the inventory is critical in the calculation of a company’s profits and working capital.",
    "Examples of Ways to Value Inventory": "Since the costs of products are likely to change during an accounting year (seems there is always some inflation), a company must select a cost flow assumption that will be used consistently. Examples of cost flow assumptions that U.S. companies use include:",
    "Definition of Cash Flow and Funds Flow Statements": "The cash flow statement, known formally as the Statement of Cash Flows, reports a company’s change in cash and cash equivalents from one balance sheet date to another. The major cash flows are presented in one of three classifications:",
    "Example of Cash Flow Statement": "The cash flow statement reports the following financial information:",
    "Definition of New Machine’s Effect on Profit": "The purchase of a new machine that will be used in a business will affect the profit and loss statement (income statement) when the machine is placed into service and the depreciation expense begins. This expense will reduce the company’s profits (net income, earnings). There may also be some additional revenues and costs, and perhaps cost savings, that will also affect the profits reported on the income statement. Since depreciation spreads the machine’s cost to depreciation expense over the life of the machine, the impact on the company’s profit may be relatively small in the first accounting year compared to the cost of the machine. ",
    "Example of New Machine’s Effect on Profit": "Assume that a company’s accounting year ends on December 31 of each year. On July 1, the company purchases a new machine for $300,000 that is expected to have no salvage value at the end of its 10-year useful life. If the company uses the straight-line method of depreciation, the depreciation expense in the first accounting year will be $15,000 ($300,000/10 years = $30,000 per year X 1/2 year). For the next nine accounting years the depreciation expense will be $30,000 and then $15,000 in the final accounting year. If the machine is used by a manufacturer, the depreciation, electricity, and maintenance of the machine will be part of manufacturing overhead. This overhead is assigned to (and will cling to) the products manufactured. If the products are in inventory, their cost (including some of the machine’s depreciation) will be part of the inventory. When the products are sold, the overhead costs (including some of the machine’s depreciation) will be part of the cost of goods sold shown on the income statement.",
    "Definition of an Asset Account": "An asset account is a general ledger account used to sort and store the debit and credit amounts from a company’s transactions involving the company’s resources. The balances in the asset accounts will be summarized and reported on the company’s balance sheet. Generally, the asset account balances are debit balances and are increased with a debit entry and decreased with a credit entry.",
    "Examples of Asset Accounts": "Some examples of asset accounts include Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Buildings, Equipment, Vehicles, Goodwill, and many more. Two asset accounts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation, are known as contra asset accounts since these accounts are expected to have credit balances.",
    "Asset Accounts Are Permanent or Real Accounts": "Asset accounts are referred to as permanent or real accounts since they are not closed at the end of the accounting year. Instead, each asset account’s balance at the end of the accounting year is carried forward to become the beginning balance of the next accounting year.",
    "Advantage of Historical Cost for Property, Plant and Equipment": "An advantage of reporting the historical cost is that the amount is objective, unbiased, verifiable, and therefore easily audited. The reason is that there will be lots of documentation such as contracts, invoices, payments, transfer taxes, and so on. On the other hand, reporting the current value (instead of historical cost) of these assets is more subjective and could lead to some exaggerated amounts.  Outside of the financial statements amounts, companies could get estimated current or replacement values from appraisers.",
    "Example of Petty Cash Affecting Expenses": "Assume that the petty cash money is used to pay postage of $10. While the company incurs this cost at the time of payment, it will be recorded in the general ledger account Postage Expense when the petty cash fund is replenished.  In order to get the expenses entered in the proper accounting period, it is necessary to replenish the petty cash fund at the end of each accounting period. (This is done in addition to replenishing the fund whenever the currency and coins are low.)",
    "Definition of Employee Loan": "When a company lends money to one of its employees, the company is reducing its Cash and increasing another asset such as Other Receivables-Advances to Employees (if a note is not involved) or Notes Receivable from Employees. ",
    "Example of Employee Loan": "Assume an employee’s car needs an $800 repair and the employee does not have the money. The company employer agrees to give the employee an $800 advance to pay for the repair. The accounting entry made by the company in its general ledger accounts is as follows:",
    "Definition of Cost and Price": "In accounting, the term cost  can mean the cash or cash equivalent amount a company paid to acquire an asset or the amount of an expense it incurred. A manufacturer’s product cost is the cost of the product’s materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Some manufacturers use standard costs in their accounting system.  The term price  is used when referring to the amount that a seller has established for its products. Accountants might state that a product’s selling price is equal to its costs + profit. However, the terms cost and price are often used interchangeably.",
    "Example of Cost and Price": "To illustrate that the terms cost and price might be used interchangeably (even by accountants) we provide the following example… Best Supply Company sold 10,000 pounds of materials to Mack Manufacturing Co. for $3 per pound. Mack recorded the materials in its Materials Inventory account at its standard cost of $2.80 per pound. The difference between Mack’s actual cost of $3 per pound and Mack’s standard cost per pound of $2.80 times 10,000 pounds is a $2,000 cost variance for Mack. However, accountants refer to this unfavorable cost variance as a materials purchase price variance.",
    "Definition of Reserve": "Many decades ago, U.S. accountants decided to eliminate the word reserve when reporting the balances in contra asset accounts. The accounting profession felt that the word reserve might be interpreted to mean that money had been set aside to replace certain assets. ",
    "Examples of Past Use of Reserve": "Two examples where the term reserve had been used include the following contra asset accounts:",
    "Definition of Provision": "The term provision is sometimes used by corporations when reporting an expense that is an estimated or uncertain amount. Two examples include Provision for Doubtful Account Expense and Provision for Income Tax Expense. NOTE: While some accountants use the term provision to describe the current year expense/increase in an account balance, others use provision to mean the balance in an account balance.",
    "Definition of Product Costs": "Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.",
    "Examples of Product Costs": "The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.",
    "Definition of Period Costs": "Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.",
    "Example of Period Costs": "Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",
    "Definition of Double Entry": "In accounting, double entry means that every transaction will involve at least two accounts.  Double entry also requires that one account be debited and the other account be credited. Accounting software might record the effect on one account automatically and only require information on the other account. ",
    "Examples of Double Entry": "When a company borrows money from a bank, the company’s asset Cash is increased and the company’s liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable is increased. When a company pays a six-month insurance premium, the company’s asset Cash is decreased and its asset Prepaid Insurance is increased. Each month, one-sixth of the premium is recorded as Insurance Expense and the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced. When an employee works for hourly wages, the company’s account Wages Expense is increased and its liability account Wages Payable is increased. When the employee is paid, the account Wages Payable is decreased and Cash is decreased. When a company’s software prepares a check, the software will automatically reduce the Cash account. Therefore, the company needs to indicate the other account (such as Accounts Payable, an expense, etc.).",
    "Definition of Stockholder and Shareholder": "The term stockholder or shareholder typically describes an investor who own shares of a corporation’s common stock. An owner of a corporation’s preferred stock is usually referred to as a preferred stockholder or preferred shareholder. Stockholders may receive dividends based on the number of shares of stock they own. Stockholders also hope to see the market value of their shares of stock increase. In short, there is no difference between a stockholder and a shareholder. ",
    "Definition of Statement of Cash Flows": "The statement of cash flows (SCF) is one of the required external financial statements. The SCF is commonly referred to as the cash flow statement. The statement of cash flows presents the following information:",
    "Example of Statement of Cash Flows": "You can see an example of an SCF by searching the internet for any corporation whose stock is publicly traded. You will see that the SCF shows the corporation’s cash inflows without parentheses, and the cash outflows are shown in parentheses. The major cash flows are arranged in the financial statement as follows:",
    "Definition of Sole Proprietorship": "A sole proprietorship is a form of business organization that is owned by one person and is easy to start. The owner is referred to as a sole proprietor. It is important to note that a sole proprietorship is not legally separate from its owner (as would be the case with a corporation). However, the sole proprietor may be able to register as a limited liability company in order to limit his or her personal liability. You should seek professional advice as to the appropriate form of business for your situation and location. In addition, your state government will likely have an office to assist in starting a new business.",
    "Accounting for Sole Proprietorships": "In accounting, the balance sheet of the sole proprietorship reflects the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity. Owner’s equity consists of the owner’s capital account and a drawing account. The drawing account is a temporary account in which the owner’s current year draws or withdrawals are recorded. The sole proprietor withdraws money for personal use because he or she is not paid a salary or wages. As a result, the income statement for the sole proprietorship business does not include an expense for the owner working in the business. This means that the reported net income is the total return for the owner’s work and investment.",
    "Definition of Inventory Accuracy": "Inventory accuracy means the following:",
    "Example of Importance of Accurate Inventory": "Here is an example of why accuracy in calculating inventory is important. After accounting for the total cost of 1) the items purchased or produced in the current period, plus 2) the costs of items carried over from the previous period, must be divided up as follows:",
    "Definition of Gross Sales": "Gross sales are the amounts a company earned from selling its products. The amounts originate from the company’s sales invoices but the total will be adjusted to the accrual basis at the end of each accounting period.",
    "Example of Gross Sales": "A company’s original sales invoice amounts are the source for the company’s gross sales. These amounts are recorded as credit entries in the general ledger account Sales. Any sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts should be recorded as debit entries in separate contra revenue accounts to inform management of their magnitude. Therefore, gross sales can also be defined as the company’s sales revenues before deducting the sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. (The amount remaining after these deductions is known as net sales.) The income statements of publicly-traded corporations typically begin with net sales or net revenues.",
    "What is Separation of Duties": "The separation of duties is one of various internal control techniques for safeguarding a company’s assets. By separating employee’s duties, the likelihood of theft, embezzlement, etc. is reduced. The reason is it will now require two dishonest people working together to admit to each other that they are dishonest and then plan and carry out the crime.",
    "Example of Separation of Duties": "A bank requires that its night depository safe be opened twice a day and the deposits processed immediately. Rather than have one person opening and emptying the safe, the bank requires that an officer and another employee open the safe and take the deposits to a third person (bank teller) who processes the deposits. Further, the bank sends or makes available bank statements showing all of the customer’s deposits and other transactions. Having the duties separated, it is difficult to hide a theft for an extended time.",
    "Definition of How and When to Depreciate an Asset": "Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost (minus any salvage value), whichever comes first. The amount of depreciation over the asset’s useful life is the asset’s cost minus an estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life. The result of this calculation is sometimes referred to as the asset’s depreciable cost.  For a company’s financial statements the asset’s depreciable cost (based on the estimated salvage value) is divided by the estimated years of useful life to arrive at a consistent annual amount to be debited to Depreciation Expense and is credited to Accumulated Depreciation. This method is know as the straight-line depreciation. For U.S. income taxes the Internal Revenue Service has specified the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows a company’s tax return to deduct larger amounts of depreciation in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets’ lives. This accelerated depreciation can be used on the tax returns at the same time that straight-line depreciation is used on the company’s financial statements.",
    "Example of How and When to Depreciate an Asset": "Assume that a U.S. corporation purchases new equipment at a cost of $700,000 and expects the equipment to have $0 salvage value at the end of its 10-year useful life. The company’s annual depreciation for a full accounting year will be $70,000 ($700,000 – $0 salvage value = $700,000/10 years = $70,000). The depreciation begins when the asset is put into service. For income tax purposes the depreciation depends on the tax regulations in the year that the asset is put into service. It is possible there is some “bonus” depreciation, a required 7-year life, an accelerated method assumed, etc. These tax regulations affect when the total amount of $700,000 in depreciation is taken. In other words, the total amount of depreciation over the life of the asset is $700,000 on the financial statements and on the tax return. The difference is when the $700,000 is reported as depreciation expense. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",
    "Definition of Contributed Capital": "Contributed capital is one of the major components of a corporation’s stockholders’ equity. Contributed capital is often described as paid-in capital and as corporation’s permanent capital. Typically, a corporation issues shares of its  common stock and receives cash for the stock’s fair market value. The transaction will be recorded with a debit to the Cash account and a credit to one or two contributed capital accounts such as Common Stock (and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Value). If the corporation exchanges some of its shares of common stock for property, the fair market value of the stock or the property (whichever is more clear) is debited to the property account and credited to one or two contributed capital accounts.  Note that both the corporation’s assets increased and its stockholders’ equity (specifically the contributed capital) increased.",
    "Example of Contributed Capital": "Assume a corporation issued and sold 10,000 new shares of its common stock for $900,000. The money received by the corporation is debited to the current asset Cash and $900,000 is credited to a contributed capital account such as Common Stock. Assume that two days later the corporation purchases real estate consisting of land and a warehouse/office building for $700,000. Assume that the land is appraised to be 1/7 of the real estate cost. After the real estate purchase, the corporation’s general ledger accounts will have a debit balance of $200,000 in the current asset account Cash, a debit balance of $100,000 in the noncurrent asset account Land, a debit balance of $600,000 in the noncurrent asset account Warehouse/Office Building, and a $900,000 credit balance in the contributed capital account Common Stock. After several accounting periods, the amounts in the asset accounts will change from the depreciation of the building and from hundreds of other transactions. However, the amount in the Common Stock account will normally remain at $900,000.",
    "Definition of Turnover": "In accounting, the term turnover can have more than one meaning. In some countries turnover is used in place of sales. Turnover also pertains to certain financial ratios that relate a balance sheet (average) amount to an income statement amount.  Outside of accounting, turnover is used to express the rate at which a company has to replace the employees who leave the company.",
    "Examples of Turnover in Financial Ratios": "The following are a few of the most common financial ratios in which a turnover is computed:",

    "Definition of Sale of a Plant Asset": "The sale of a plant asset is often the disposal of a company’s equipment (or other asset) that had been used in the company’s business operations.  When a plant asset is sold, the following steps must be reflected in the company’s general ledger accounts:",
    "Example of a Sale of a Plant Asset": "Assume that Company XYZ wants to dispose of some production equipment that had a cost of $210,000 several years ago. As of the time of the disposal, the equipment’s accumulated depreciation is $195,000. ABC Company is willing to remove the equipment and pay XYZ $10,000. Since XYZ is not in the business of buying and selling equipment, this sale of equipment is a “peripheral” activity and is not reported as part of its sales revenue. Instead, XYZ remove’s the equipment’s cost of $210,000 and the related accumulated depreciation of $195,000. Therefore, the book value of $15,000 is being removed from the general ledger accounts and cash of $10,000 is being added. This $5,000 loss (cash received of $10,000 minus book value of $15,000) is reported on the income statement as a separate item. Often this loss appears in the income statement section entitled Other or Nonoperating.  The $10,000 of proceeds from the sale of the plant asset is also reported as a positive amount in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.",
    "Definition of Recording a Yearly Subscription": "Typically, yearly subscriptions are paid in advance or at the start of the subscription period. If the amount of a company’s subscription is insignificant, the company will debit Subscription Expense and will credit Cash (or Accounts Payable).  If the amount of the subscription is significant, the company should debit the cost of the subscription to the current asset account Prepaid Expenses and credit Cash. During the period of the subscription, the company credits Prepaid Expenses and debits Subscription Expense for the amount that is expiring.",
    "Example of Recording a Yearly Subscription": "Assume that a company pays $1,200 on March 20 for a one-year subscription for a business newsletter that will begin on April 1. Also assume the company issues monthly financial statements and that the $1,200 cost is considered to be significant. On March 20, the company debits Prepaid Expenses for $1,200 and credits Cash for $1,200. At the end of each month (starting on April 30), the company will record a deferral adjusting entry to debit Subscription Expense for $100 and credit Prepaid Expenses for $100. The 12 monthly adjusting entries will:",
    "Definition of Chart of Accounts": "The chart of accounts is a listing of the names and account numbers for the general ledger accounts available for recording amounts. However, the chart of accounts will not include any transaction amounts or account balances. The chart of accounts is helpful for identifying the accounts to be used when encountering less frequent transactions. The chart of accounts and the general ledger accounts can also be modified to provide more detailed information, reflect changes in the business operations, etc.",
    "Examples of Chart of Accounts": "The chart of accounts is likely arranged in the same order as the general ledger. That is, the balance sheet accounts are listed first, followed by the income statement accounts.  A large corporation’s chart of accounts could consist of thousands of accounts each with an account number (perhaps with more than 10 digits) and an account title. The chart of accounts for a very small company might consist of less than one hundred accounts with an account number having 3 digits. The first digit of a six-digit account number will likely indicate the type of account. For instance, an asset account number will begin with the digit “1”. Liability accounts will begin with the digit “2”. Operating revenue accounts will begin with the digit “3”, etc. Operating expenses will use accounts beginning with digits such as “4” through “7”. Nonoperating revenues, nonoperating expenses, gains, losses, and other items might begin with “9”. At a large company, the second digit of the account numbers might indicate the division within the company, while the third digit will indicate a department within the division. The remaining digits of the account numbers will indicate the type of revenue, type of expense, etc. Popular accounting software will include some examples of charts of accounts. Our Explanation of Chart of Accounts includes two hypothetical examples.",
    "Definition of Depreciation Methods": "There are various methods of depreciating assets that are used in a business. It is acceptable and common for companies to use two or more of the methods of depreciation.",
    "Examples of Using Two Methods of Depreciation": "It is very common for a company to depreciate its plant assets by using straight-line depreciation on its financial statements, while using an accelerated method of depreciation on its income tax return. A company could also be depreciating its equipment by using a useful life of 10 years for its financial statements, while using a useful life of 7 years for its income tax return. Even the depreciation for a company’s financial statements could consist of some assets being depreciated using the units of production or units of activity method, while other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method.",
    "Definition of a Fully Depreciated Asset": "A fully depreciated asset is one that has accumulated depreciation equal to its cost. Hence, the book value of the asset is $0. Once an asset is fully depreciated, there will be no additional depreciation expense.",
    "Example of a Fully Depreciated Asset": "Let’s assume that a company purchased a building more than 30 years ago at a cost of $600,000. The company then depreciated the building at a rate of $20,000 per year for 30 years. Today the building continues to be used by the company and it plans to continue using it for many more years. The company’s current balance sheet will report the building at its cost of $600,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $600,000 (a book value of $0) even if the building’s current market value is $2,000,000. Unless there are improvements to the building, there will be no depreciation expense after the 30th year.",
    "Definition of Inventory Error": "An inventory error could be the result of any of the following:",
    "Example of an Inventory Error": "Assume that a company began operations on December 1. During December the company purchased $100,000 of goods that it planned to sell to customers. The company’s December 31 ending inventory was calculated to be $15,000. As a result, its balance sheet will report inventory of $15,000 and its income statement will report cost of goods sold of $85,000 ($100,000 – $15,000). During January the company purchased $130,000 of goods and had $20,000 in inventory at the end of January 31. Therefore, January’s cost of goods sold will be $125,000 (beginning inventory of $15,000 plus purchases of $130,000 minus ending inventory of $20,000). Now let’s assume that only one error occurred and it involved the calculation of the December 31 ending inventory. Instead of the $15,000 which was reported, the true amount of inventory was $19,000. That meant the December 31 balance sheet understated the true cost of inventory by $4,000. It also meant that December’s income statement  cost of goods sold was not the reported $85,000. Rather, the true cost of goods sold was $81,000 ($100,000 minus $19,000 of inventory). In January, the true cost of goods sold is $129,000 (beginning inventory of $19,000 plus the purchases of $130,000 minus the January 31 inventory of $20,000) not the $125,000 that had been reported.",
    "Definition of Natural Business Year": "A natural business year is the period of 12 consecutive months (or 52-53 consecutive weeks) ending at a low point of the organization’s activities for the year.",
    "Examples of a Natural Business Year": "The natural business year for a school year is July 1 through June 30. The reason is that school year classes are usually finished in June. A retailer’s natural business year might be the 52-53 consecutive weeks ending on the Saturday closest to each February 1. This is a low point of activity for the retailer since its holiday season is finished, the merchandise returns from holiday sales are completed, and the January clearance sales have taken place. [The 52-53 week periods with 13-week quarters allows for better comparisons than calendar months.] Many companies have a natural business year of January 1 through December 31. On the other hand, some companies are required by government regulations to end their accounting years on December 31, even though it is not the end of their natural business year. The term fiscal year is associated with companies having financial reporting years that do not end on December 31.",
    "Definition of Net Sales": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, net sales is the total amount of goods shipped/delivered to customers during a specified period of time minus any early payment discounts (if offered by the seller) and minus allowances for goods returned by customers, adjustments to the sales invoice amounts, etc.",
    "Example of Net Sales": "Assume that in the most recent month, a retailer had $220,000 of merchandise sales. It also allowed customers $2,000 in early payment discounts. Some customers were allowed to return goods that had been sold for $4,000 and a few customers were given sales allowances for $1,000. The retailer’s net sales for the month were $213,000 ($220,000 – $2,000 – $4,000 – $1,000).",
    "Definition of Systematic and Rational Allocation": "Systematic and rational allocation is typically included in the definition of depreciation. In this context, it means that a company’s annual depreciation expense reported on its financial statements should be based on a formula that is:",
    "Example of Systematic and Rational Allocation": "Assume that a retailer purchases new fixtures which are expected to have a useful life of 10 years with no salvage value. Therefore, if the retailer pays $120,000 for new fixtures, its income statements will report depreciation expense of $12,000 each year ($1,000 each month) for 10 years. Assume that another company purchases equipment for $20,000 that will be useful for producing a total of 20,000 items. If in the first year of operations the company produces 1,800 items, the depreciation expense will be $1,800. If in the second year the company produces 3,700 units, the depreciation expense will be $3,700. Both of these depreciation calculations are logical, consistently applied, and objective.",
    "Definition Bank Reconciliation": "The bank reconciliation (if prepared or reviewed by someone other than the person with access to the checking account) is a form of internal control over a company’s checking account balance. Basically, the bank reconciliation compares the amounts in a company’s accounting records with the amounts in its bank’s records. Any differences are reconciled (explained) so that improper amounts will be exposed and the company’s records and financial statements will report the correct balance for company’s checking account. At a minimum, the bank reconciliation should be done within a few days after the end of each month. However, with the bank’s electronic records readily accessible, the bank reconciliation should be done more frequently. ",
    "Examples for a Timely Bank Reconciliation": "Some reasons for preparing a bank reconciliation as soon as possible include the following:",
    "Definition of Certificate of Deposit": "A certificate of deposit, also referred to as a CD, is a time deposit at a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. A certificate of deposit requires that the money cannot be accessed until an agreed upon maturity date. However, if the depositor insists on withdrawing the money before the maturity date, the financial institution will assess a penalty—usually the loss of interest. Since the depositor agreed to a maturity date, the certificate of deposit will pay a higher interest rate than is paid on a regular savings account or money market account. The length of a certificate of deposit will vary. It could be for one month, three months, six months, one year, 17 months, three years, etc. Generally the longer the time until maturity, the higher the interest rate. A CD that matures in less than one year will be reported by the bank as a current liability, and will be reported as a short-term investment by the depositor (provided the amount is not restricted by the depositor).",
    "Example of a Certificate of Deposit": "James Company has a seasonal business and wants to earn interest on its excess cash balance during the seven months between its busy seasons. Therefore, James Company purchased a six-month certificate of deposit for $100,000 from its local bank. The CD pays an annual rate of 1% compared to 0.4% of the bank’s money market account, 0.1% on the bank’s savings account, and 0% on the bank’s checking account.",
    "Definition of Liabilities": "Liabilities are a company’s obligations and are usually defined as a claim on the company’s assets. However, liabilities (and stockholders’ equity) can also be viewed as the sources of the company’s assets. The money raised by a company’s liabilities will generally have a lower cost than money raised from stockholders’ equity for the following reasons:",
    "Example of Liabilities": "Assume a corporation needs to replace its existing equipment with equipment that has the latest new technologies. The new equipment will result in better products at a lower cost. If the corporation is able to borrow the money needed at say 7% interest, the interest expense after the income tax benefit may be only 5%. If the cost savings from the new equipment does occur, the corporation’s present owners will enjoy the increased earnings without a reduction in their ownership percentages. ",
    "Definition of Balance Sheet and Income Statement": "The balance sheet reflects the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s (Stockholders’) Equity  When a company earns revenues by performing services for cash, its assets increase and its owner’s equity increases. When the company pays cash for an advertisement expense, its assets decrease and its owner’s equity decreases. In accounting and bookkeeping there is a separate financial statement known as the income statement that reports the revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that are recorded in income statement accounts. This allows the balance sheet account Owner’s Capital (or Retained Earnings) to avoid having all of the thousands or millions of revenue and expense transactions from appearing. Instead, only the bottom line of the income statement, net income, needs to appear in the the owner’s equity account.",
    "Example of the Connection Between the Balance Sheet and Income Statement": "Our Explanation of Accounting Equation contains a series of transactions to illustrate the connection between the income statement and the balance sheet for both a sole proprietorship and a corporation.",
    "Definition of Fixed Assets and Plant Assets": "My experience indicates that people use the term fixed assets to mean the same as plant assets. As a result, I define both fixed assets and plant assets to be noncurrent, long-lived, tangible assets used in a business. They are reported in the Property, Plant and Equipment section of the balance sheet. The fixed/plant assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives (except for land which is not depreciated).",
    "Examples of Fixed Assets and Plant Assets": "The following are examples of the non-current, tangible assets known as fixed assets and plant assets which are used within a business and are classified as property, plant and equipment:",
    "Definition of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles": "Generally accepted accounting principles (commonly referred to as GAAP or US GAAP) are the common accounting rules that must be followed when a U.S. company prepares financial statements that will be distributed to people outside of the company.  These common rules range from basic underlying principles and assumptions to the detailed rules established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for complex financial transactions. The FASB has organized the generally accepted accounting principles in its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).",
    "Why Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are Required?": "Generally accepted accounting principles are required so a knowledgeable reader of financial statements is able to do the following:",
    "Definition of Credit Sales": "As opposed to cash sales, credit sales (or sales on credit) allow the customer to pay the seller at a later date. Perhaps the seller allows its credit worthy customers to pay in 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, etc. At the time of the sale, the seller will debit Accounts Receivable and will credit Sales. When the seller receives payment from the customer, the seller will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.",
    "Example of a Credit Sale": "Assume that SellerCo delivers $5,000 of goods to a customer on December 30 and no further action is required by SellerCo. Under the accrual basis of accounting, SellerCo will report $5,000 in its income statement accounts Sales and will report $5,000 in its current asset account Accounts Receivable. Assume that on January 31, SellerCo receives $5,000 from the customer. On this date SellerCo debits Cash for $5,000 and credits Accounts Receivable for $5,000. ",
    "Definition of Double-Entry System": "The double-entry system of accounting or bookkeeping means that for every business transaction, amounts must be recorded in a minimum of two accounts. The double-entry system also requires that for all transactions, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits.",
    "Example of a Double-Entry System": "To illustrate double entry, let’s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company’s Cash account must be increased by $10,000 and a liability account must be increased by $10,000. To increase an asset, a debit entry is required. To increase a liability, a credit entry is required. Hence, the account Cash will be debited for $10,000 and the liability Loans Payable will be credited for $10,000.",
    "Double Entry Keeps the Accounting Equation in Balance": "Double entry also means that the accounting equation (assets = liabilities + owner’s equity) will always be in balance. In our example, the accounting equation remained in balance because both assets and liabilities were each increased by $10,000.",
    "Definition of a Trial Balance": "A trial balance is a bookkeeping or accounting report that lists the balances in each of an organization’s general ledger accounts. (Often the accounts with zero balances will not be listed.) The debit balance amounts are listed in a column with the heading “Debit balances” and the credit balance amounts are listed in another column with the heading “Credit balances.” The total of each of these two columns should be identical.",
    "Examples of the Trial Balance’s Use": "The trial balance is not a financial statement. It is mainly an internal report that is/was useful in a manual accounting system. If the trial balance did not “balance” it signaled an error somewhere between the journal and the trial balance. Often the cause of the difference was a miscalculation of an account balance, posting a debit amount as a credit (or vice versa), transposing digits within an amount when posting or preparing the trial balance, etc. Today’s accounting software has been written to eliminate those errors. Hence, the trial balance is less important for bookkeeping purposes since it is almost certain that the general ledger and the trial balance will have the debits equal to the credits. The trial balance continues to be useful for auditors and accountants who wish to show 1) the general ledger account balances prior to their proposed adjustments, 2) their proposed adjustments, and 3) all of the account balances after the proposed adjustments. The adjusted amounts make up the adjusted trial balance, and the adjusted amounts will be used in the organization’s financial statements.",
    "Definition of a Journal Entry": "In manual accounting or bookkeeping systems, business transactions are first recorded in a journal…hence the term journal entry. Journal entries that are recorded in a company’s general journal will consist of the following:",
    "Examples of Journal Entries": "Even with computerized accounting systems some general journal entries are necessary. Common general journal entries are the adjusting entries. For example, prior to issuing the company’s financial statements there will be an adjusting entry to record depreciation. This journal entry will debit Depreciation Expense and will credit Accumulated Depreciation. Another example of a general journal entry is the adjusting entry to accrue interest on a bank loan. This journal entry will debit Interest Expense and will credit Interest Payable.",
    "Definition of an Accrual": "An accrual pertains to:",
    "Example of an Expense Accrual": "The accrual of an expense or an expense accrual refers to the reporting of an expense and the related liability in an accounting period that is prior to the period when the amount will be paid or the vendor’s invoice will be processed. An example of an expense accrual is the electricity that is used in December where neither the bill nor the payment will be processed until January. The December electricity should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Electricity Expense and credits a liability account such as Accrued Expenses Payable.",
    "Example of a Revenue Accrual": "The accrual of revenues or a revenue accrual refers to the reporting of revenue and the related asset in the period in which they are earned, and which is prior to processing a sales invoice or receiving the money. An example of the accrual of revenues is a bond investment’s interest that is earned in December but the money will not be received until a later accounting period. This interest should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Receivable and credits Interest Income.",
    "Definition of a Deferral": "A deferral occurs when a company has:",
    "Example of an Expense Deferral": "A deferral of an expense or an expense deferral involves a payment that was paid in advance of the accounting period(s) in which it will become an expense. An example is a payment made in December for property insurance covering the next six months of January through June. The amount that is not yet expired should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. The amount that expires in an accounting period should be reported as Insurance Expense.",
    "Example of a Revenue Deferral": "A deferral of revenues or a revenue deferral involves money that was received in advance of earning it. An example is the insurance company receiving money in December for providing insurance protection for the next six months. Until the money is earned, the insurance company should report the unearned amount as a current liability such as Unearned Insurance Premiums. As the insurance premiums are earned, they should be reported on the income statement as Insurance Premium Revenues.",
    "Defining the Entries When Selling a Fixed Asset": "When a fixed asset or plant asset is sold, there are several things that must take place:",
    "Definition of Suspense Account": "A suspense account is a general ledger account in which amounts are temporarily recorded.  The suspense account is used because the appropriate general ledger account could not be determined at the time that the transaction was recorded. As soon as possible, the amount(s) in the suspense account should be moved to the proper account(s).",
    "Example of Using a Suspense Account": "An accountant was instructed to record a significant number of journal entries written by the controller of a large company. Unfortunately, there was one amount that did not have an account designated. In order to complete the assignment by the deadline, the accountant recorded the “mystery” amount in the general ledger Suspense account. When the controller is available, the accountant will get clarification and will move the amount from the Suspense account to the appropriate account.",
    "Definition of Miscellaneous Expense": "In accounting, miscellaneous expense may refer to a general ledger account in which small, infrequent transaction amounts are recorded. The account Miscellaneous Expenses should be used as the last resort. For example, the small bank fees would be better recorded in a separate account such as Bank Service Charges instead of recording them in Miscellaneous Expenses. Miscellaneous expense may also be the description on a company’s income statement that refers to the amount consisting of small balances contained in many general ledger expense accounts.",
    "Definition of Reversing Entries": "Reversing entries are made on the first day of an accounting period to remove accrual adjusting entries that were made at the end of the previous accounting period. Two benefits of using reversing entries are:",
    "Example of Reversing Entries": "To illustrate reversing entries, let’s assume that a retailer uses a temporary employment agency service to provide workers from December 15 to December 29. The temp agency will bill the retailer on January 6 and the retailer is required to pay the invoice by January 10. Assuming the retailer’s accounting year ends on December 31, the retailer will make an accrual adjusting entry on December 31 for the estimated amount. If the estimated amount is $18,000 the retailer will debit Temp Service Expense for $18,000 and will credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000. This adjusting entry assures that the retailer’s income statement for the period ended December 31 will report the $18,000 expense and its balance sheet as of December 31 will report the $18,000 liability. After the financial statements are prepared, the closing entries will transfer the balance in the account Temp Service Expense to an owner’s/stockholders’ equity account. As a result, the account Temp Service Expense will begin January with a zero balance.   When a reversing entry is recorded as of January 1, it simply removes the estimated amounts contained in the December 31 accrual adjusting entry. In other words, the January 1 reversing entry will:",
    "Examples of Accounts with Debit Balances": "The following general ledger account classifications normally have debit balances:",
    "Definition of Advance to an Employee": "A cash advance to an employee is usually a temporary loan by a company to an employee. In other words, the company is the lender and the employee is the borrower. The cash advance needs to be reported as a reduction in the company’s Cash account and an increase in an asset account such as Advance to Employees or Other Receivables: Advances. (If the amount is expected to be repaid within one year, this account will be reported as a current asset.) If the cash advance is repaid through payroll withholdings, the routine payroll entry will record the amount withheld as a credit to Advance to Employees. This in turn results in a smaller amount being credited to Net Payroll Payable.",
    "Example of Advance to an Employee": "Let’s assume that a valuable employee’s car requires an emergency repair of $800. The employee is unable to pay for the repair and has no other means for getting to work. The company agrees to lend the employee $800 and to withhold $100 per week from the employee’s weekly payroll checks until the $800 is repaid. The company will debit the current asset Advance to Employees for $800 and will credit Cash for $800. The weekly payroll processing will result in a credit of $100 to Advance to Employees (thereby reducing by $100 the amount credited to Net Payroll Payable).",
    "Definition of Drawing Account": "A sole proprietorship will have a drawing account in which the owner’s withdrawals or draws of cash or other assets are recorded. The amounts of the owner’s draws are recorded with a debit to the drawing account and a credit to cash or other asset. At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed by transferring the debit balance to the owner’s capital account.",
    "The Drawing Account is a Capital Account": "To answer your question, the drawing account is a capital account. It’s debit balance will reduce the owner’s capital account balance and the owner’s equity. The drawing account’s purpose is to report separately the owner’s draws during each accounting year. Since the capital account and owner’s equity accounts are expected to have credit balances, the drawing account (having a debit balance) is considered to be a contra account. In addition, the drawing account is a temporary account since its balance is closed to the capital account at the end of each accounting year. ",
    "Example of the Drawing Account": "Let’s assume that L. Ott begins a sole proprietorship with a cash investment of $3,000. The journal entry will debit Cash for $3,000 and will credit L. Ott, Capital for $3,000. Later, the L. Ott withdraws $500 from the business for her personal use. The journal entry for this transaction will debit L. Ott, Drawing for $500 and will credit Cash for $500. After this transaction, the business will have assets of $2,500 and will have owner’s equity of $2,500.  ",
    "Definition of Contra Account": "A contra account is a general ledger account with an account balance that is the opposite of the normal balance for that account classification. For example, Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account that is associated with asset accounts for buildings, equipment, vehicles, etc. The asset accounts have debit balances, but the related account Accumulated Depreciation will have a credit balance. ",
    "Examples of Contra Accounts": "To illustrate, let’s use the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Since it is a contra asset account, this allowance account must have a credit balance (which is contrary to the debit balances found in asset accounts). The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is directly related to the asset account entitled Accounts Receivable. Therefore, if the Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $40,000 and the allowance account has a credit balance of $2,000, the readers of the balance sheet will see that customers owe $40,000 for past purchases but the company does not expect to collect $2,000 of the $40,000. Therefore, the net amount of the accounts receivable that is expected to turn to cash is $38,000. A second example of a contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. For instance, if a company has a plant asset such as Equipment with a debit balance of $92,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $50,000, the carrying amount (or book value) of the equipment is $42,000. The income statement account Sales Returns and Allowances is a contra revenue account that is associated with the revenue account Sales. If the balance in this contra account is a debit of $3,000 and the Sales account has the expected credit balance of $400,000, the company’s net sales are $397,000. This use of Sales Returns and Allowances (instead of debiting Sales) enables management to see that its customers had a problem with $3,000 of the company’s goods.",
    "Definition of Dividends Account": "When a corporation declares a cash dividend, the amount declared will reduce the amount of the corporation’s retained earnings. Instead of debiting the Retained Earnings account at the time the dividend is declared, a corporation could instead debit a related account entitled Dividends (or Cash Dividends Declared). However, at the end of the accounting year, the balance in the Dividends account will be closed by transferring its balance to the Retained Earnings account. When interim financial statements are issued, the amount reported for the corporation’s retained earnings will be the combination of the credit balance in the Retained Earnings account and the debit balance in the Dividends account.  Both the Dividends account and the Retained Earnings account are part of stockholders’ equity. They are somewhat similar to the sole proprietor’s Drawing account and Capital account which are part of owner’s equity. Both the Dividends account and the Drawing account are temporary balance sheet accounts since they are closed at the end of each year in order for the accounts to begin the following year with $0 balances.",
    "Example of Using the Dividends Account": "Assume a corporation declares a cash dividend of $50,000 on its common stock.\nOn the date the dividend is declared, the corporation will credit the current liability account Dividends Payable for $50,000 and will debit either one of the following accounts for $50,000:",
    "Definition of an Accounts Payable Credit": "Since Accounts Payable is a liability account, it should have a credit balance. The credit balance indicates the amount that a company or organization owes to its suppliers or vendors. If a company purchases additional goods or services on credit (as opposed to paying with cash), the company will need to credit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance will increase accordingly.",
    "Definition of an Accounts Payable Debit": "If a company pays one of its suppliers the amount that is included in Accounts Payable, the company will need to debit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance is decreased.",
    "Definition of Real Account": "The balance in a real account is not closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a real account begins each accounting year with its balance from the end of the previous year. Because the end-of-the-year balance is carried forward to the next accounting year, a real account is also known as a permanent account.",
    "Examples of Real Accounts": "The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts such as the accounts for recording assets, liabilities, and the owner’s (or stockholders’) equity. However, the sole proprietor’s drawing account, which is reported on the balance sheet during the year, is a temporary account because it is closed directly to the owner’s capital account at the end of the year.",
    "Why Expenses Are Debited": "Expenses cause owner’s equity to decrease. Since owner’s equity’s normal balance is a credit balance, an expense must be recorded as a debit. At the end of the accounting year the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner’s capital account, thereby reducing owner’s equity. (At a corporation, the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders’ equity account.)",
    "Example of Why Expenses Are Debited": "To illustrate why expenses are debited, let’s assume that a new company has only one asset, Cash of $10,000, and its owner’s equity is $10,000. The company then pays $500 for advertising that occurs at the time of payment. The company must reduce its Cash (which has a debit balance of $10,000) by entering a credit of $500. To comply with double-entry accounting, the company must record a debit of $500, which will be entered in Advertising Expense. Let’s also assume this was the only transaction for the year. As a result, the company’s balance sheet will report assets of $9,500 and owner’s equity of $9,500. As you can see, there are two reasons why Advertising Expense had to be debited:",
    "Definition of a Real Account": "A real account is a general ledger account that does not close at the end of the accounting year. In other words, the balances in the real accounts are carried over to become the beginning balances of the next accounting period. Real accounts are also referred to as permanent accounts.",
    "Definition of Sundry Expenses": "In accounting and bookkeeping, sundry expenses are expenses that are small in amount and rare in occurrence. For these rare and insignificant expenses, a company might use a general ledger account entitled Sundry Expenses for these items. If any of the items recorded in Sundry Expenses begin to occur frequently and/or become significant, a new account should be opened for such items. Sundry expenses could also refer to a line on a company’s income statement. Such a line will likely include the combined total of several expense accounts that have small balances. Today, we are likely to use the description Miscellaneous Expenses for these items.",
    "Definition of Supplies": "Office supplies are items used to carry out tasks in a company’s departments outside of manufacturing or shipping. Office supplies are likely to include paper, printer cartridges, pens, etc.  Shipping supplies are the cartons, tape, shrink wrap, etc. for preparing products that are being shipped to customers. Manufacturing supplies are items used in the manufacturing facilities, but are not a direct material for the products manufactured. These will include a wide variety of items from cleaning supplies to machine lubricants.",
    "Accounting for Office Supplies": "The cost of office supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period should be the balance in a current asset account such as Supplies or Supplies on Hand. The cost of the office supplies used up during the accounting period should be recorded in the income statement account Supplies Expense. When supplies are purchased, the amount will be debited to Supplies. At the end of the accounting period, the balance in the account Supplies will be adjusted to be the amount on hand, and the amount of the adjustment will be recorded in Supplies Expense. (If the amount of supplies on hand is insignificant, a company may simply debit Supplies Expense when the supplies are purchased.) ",
    "Accounting for Shipping Supplies": "The cost of shipping supplies on hand will be reported as a current asset on the balance sheet and the shipping supplies used during the accounting period will be reported on the income statement as Shipping Supplies Expense.",
    "Accounting for Manufacturing Supplies": "The cost of manufacturing supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period will be reported in a balance sheet current asset account such as Inventory of Manufacturing Supplies. (There are likely to be several accounts or sub-accounts in order keep track of the manufacturing supplies by category.) When the manufacturing supplies are used they will become part of the manufacturing overhead, which is then allocated to the products manufactured.",
    "Examples of Credit Balances": "A credit balance is normal and expected for the following accounts:",
    "Definition of Cash Short and Over Account": "The account Cash Short and Over is an income statement account (within a company’s general ledger) in which shortages or overages of cash are recorded. The Cash Short and Over account might be used by:",
    "Example of How the Account Cash Short and Over is Used": "Let’s illustrate the Cash Short and Over account with the petty cash fund. Assume that the company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash reports an imprest balance of $100. Let’s now assume that when the petty cash fund is replenished, there is $6.00 on hand and there are $93.00 of petty cash vouchers. This indicates a shortage of $1.00. Using the above information, the journal entry to replenish the petty cash fund will include a credit of $94.00 to the account Cash: Checking Account. (This is the amount of the company check that will be cashed to get the cash in the petty cash fund back to the imprest general ledger amount of $100.) The debits will be the accounts and amounts shown on the petty cash receipts, which total $93. To get the journal entry to balance, a debit of $1 is recorded in Cash Short and Over.",
    "Definition of Bookkeeping": "Bookkeeping includes the recording, storing and retrieving of financial transactions for a business, nonprofit organization, individual, etc.",
    "Examples of Bookkeeping Tasks": "Typical financial transactions and tasks that are involved in bookkeeping include:",
    "Definition of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts": "The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that is used with the balance in Accounts Receivable to report the net realizable value of the receivables. ",
    "Example of Adjusting the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts": "The balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts should be the estimated amount of the company’s receivables that will not be turning to cash. For example, if the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts presently has a credit balance of $2,000 and you believe there is a total of $2,900 in Accounts Receivable that will not be collected, you need to enter an additional credit amount of $900 into the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The other part of this adjusting entry will be a debit of $900 to Bad Debts Expense. Note that some authors and companies may refer to the allowance account as Allowance for Uncollectible Expense, Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts. The related income statement account could have the title of Uncollectible Accounts Expense, Doubtful Accounts Expense, etc.",
    "Definition of Short Term Bank Loan": "When a company borrows money from its bank and agrees to repay the loan amount within a year, the company will record the loan by increasing its cash and increasing a current liability such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable. The bank will record the loan by increasing a current asset such as Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable and increasing a current liability such as Customer Demand Deposits.",
    "Example of a Company Recording a Loan from a Bank": "Let’s assume that a company obtains a $30,000 bank loan that must be repaid within 9 months. The bank deposits the loan proceeds of $30,000 into the company’s checking account at the same bank. The double entry to be recorded by the company is: 1) a debit of $30,000 to the company’s current asset account Cash for the amount that the bank deposited into the company’s checking account, and 2) a credit of $30,000 to the company’s current liability account Notes Payable (or Loans Payable) for the amount of principal that it must repay to the bank. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)",
    "Example of a Bank Recording a Loan to a Customer": "The double entry to be recorded by the bank is: 1) a debit to the bank’s current asset account Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable for the principal amount it expects to collect, and 2) a credit to the bank’s current liability account Customer Demand Deposits. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)",
    "Why Revenues are Credited": "Revenues cause owner’s equity to increase. Since the normal balance for owner’s equity is a credit balance, revenues must be recorded as a credit. At the end of the accounting year, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner’s capital account, thereby increasing owner’s equity. (At a corporation, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders’ equity account.) It may be helpful to think of the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity, to understand why an asset (shown on the left side of the accounting equation) will normally have its account balance on the left side or debit side. Liabilities and owner’s equity accounts (shown on the right side of the accounting equation) will normally have their account balances on the right side or credit side.",
    "Example of Why Revenues are Credited": "To illustrate why revenues are credited, let’s assume that a company receives $900 at the time that it provides a service and therefore is earning the $900. The increase in the company’s assets will be recorded with a debit of $900 to Cash. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, a credit of $900 will be recorded in the account Service Revenues. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that owner’s equity will be increasing. If the company earns an additional $500 of revenue but allows the customer to pay in 30 days, the company will increase its asset account Accounts Receivable with a debit of $500. It must also record a credit of $500 in Service Revenues because the revenue was earned. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that the owner’s equity will be increasing.",
    "Entries To Record a Sale of Equipment": "When equipment that is used in a business is disposed of (sold) for cash before it is fully depreciated, two steps must be taken:",
    "Definition of Income Summary Account": "The Income Summary account is a temporary account used with closing entries in a manual accounting system. (Computerized accounting systems may close the temporary accounts without recording the amounts in an Income Summary account.) The Income Summary is very temporary since it has a zero balance throughout the year until the year-end closing entries are made. Next, the balance resulting from the closing entries will be moved to Retained Earnings (if a corporation) or the owner’s capital account (if a sole proprietorship).",
    "Example of Income Summary Account": "In a manual accounting system, the closing entries will result in the following amounts in Income Summary:",
    "Examples of Debit Balances": "A debit balance is normal and expected for the following accounts:",
    "Definition of Loan to Employee": "A loan to an employee is money advanced by the company to assist the employee. If the employee is expected to repay the loan within one year of the balance sheet date, the loan balance is a current asset of the company. Any amount not expected to be collected within one year is a noncurrent or long term asset. It is common for the loan to an employee to specify an interest rate and a schedule of payments.",
    "Entry to Record a Loan to Employee": "Assume that a company lends an employee $5,000 for a family emergency. The entry will debit Loan to Employee for $5,000 and will credit Cash for $5,000. Under the accrual method of accounting, at each balance sheet date the company should record any accrued interest  by debiting Interest Receivable and crediting Interest Income. When the employee makes a payment, the company will debit Cash and will credit Interest Receivable and Loan to Employee for the appropriate amounts. ",
    "Definition of Bill Payable": "A bill payable is a document which shows the amount owed for goods or services received on credit (meaning not paid at the time that the goods or services were received). The provider of the goods or services is referred to as the supplier or vendor. Hence, a bill payable is also known as an unpaid vendor invoice.",
    "Examples of Bills Payable": "Examples of a bill payable include a monthly telephone bill, the monthly bill for the electricity used, a bill for repairs that were completed, the bill for merchandise purchased by a retailer on credit, etc. ",
    "Recording a Bill Payable": "Under the accrual method of accounting or bookkeeping, a bill payable or unpaid vendor invoice is recorded in Accounts Payable with a credit entry. (The debit will likely be recorded as an expense or asset.) When the bill is paid, Accounts Payable will be reduced with a debit entry, and Cash will be decreased with a credit entry. The credit balance in Accounts Payable is reported on the company’s balance sheet as a current liability.",
    "Definition of an Adjusted Trial Balance": "The adjusted trial balance is an internal document that lists the general ledger account titles and their balances after any adjustments have been made. The adjusted trial balance is not a financial statement, but the adjusted account balances will be reported on the financial statements. The adjusted trial balance (as well as the unadjusted trial balance) must have the total amount of the debit balances equal to the total amount of credit balances.",
    "Examples of Adjusted Trial Balances": "In a manual accounting system, an unadjusted trial balance might be prepared by a bookkeeper to be certain that the general ledger has debit amounts equal to the credit amounts. After that is the case, the unadjusted trial balance is used by an accountant to indicate the necessary adjusting entries and the resulting adjusted balances. The adjusted balances are summed to become the adjusted trial balance.  An adjusted trial balance can also refer to a trial balance where the account balances are adjusted by the external auditors. The adjusted balances become the adjusted trial balance. ",
    "Definition of Overstated": "When an accountant uses the term overstated, it means two things:",
    "Example of Overstated": "If a company reports that its prepaid insurance is $8,000, but the true or correct amount of prepaid insurance is only $7,000, the accountant will say that the reported amount of prepaid insurance is overstated by $1,000. In a double-entry accounting system, if the balance in the account Prepaid Insurance is overstated (too much is being reported) it is likely that the account Insurance Expense is understated (too little is being reported).",
    "Definition of Credit Card Payments": "We define a credit card payment as the amount a company remits to the credit card company for the purchases that occurred by using the credit card. The company’s payment to the credit card company will result in a credit to the company’s Cash account. However, the debit portion of the payment entry depends on whether the individual credit card purchases had been previously recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts.",
    "Example of Recording Credit Card Payments": "Assuming that the credit card purchases had not been previously entered into the accounts, there will be many debits in order to record each of the many credit card purchases/transactions into the company’s appropriate general ledger account(s). Assuming that the credit card purchases were recorded in the general ledger accounts prior to the company paying the credit card bill, the payment to the credit card company might be recorded with a credit to Cash and a single debit to Credit Card Payable (if that account was used when recording the credit card purchases).",
    "Definition of a Ledger": "A ledger is often defined as a book of accounts. Today the ledger and its accounts are likely to be an electronic record or file.",
    "Example of a Ledger": "An example of a ledger is a company’s general ledger, which contains all of its asset, liability, owner equity, revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts. Each account contains the transaction amounts that pertain to the account title. ",
    "Definition of Sales Discounts": "Sales discounts (if offered by sellers) reduce the amounts owed to the sellers of products, when the buyers pay within the stated discount periods. Sales discounts are also known as cash discounts and early payment discounts. Sales discounts are recorded in a contra revenue account such as Sales Discounts. Hence, its debit balance will be one of the deductions from sales (gross sales) in order to report the amount of net sales.",
    "Example of Sales Discounts": "To illustrate a sales discount let’s assume that a manufacturer sells $900 of products and its credit terms are 1/10, n/30. This means that the buyer can satisfy the $900 obligation if it pays $891 ($900 minus $9 of sales discount) within 10 days. The alternative is for the buyer to pay $900 within 30 days. If the buyer pays the $891 within 10 days, the seller will record the money received as follows:",
    "Accrued Income Reported on the Balance Sheet": "The amount of accrued income that a corporation has a right to receive as of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the current asset section of the balance sheet. It could be described as accrued receivables or accrued income. The amount of the accrued income reported on the income statement also causes an increase in a corporation’s retained earnings, which is part of the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet. Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale – Corporation",
    "Definition of Purchase Discount": "A purchase discount is a deduction that a company may receive if the supplier offers it and the company pays the supplier’s invoice within a specified period of time. The purchase discount is also known as a cash discount or early-payment discount. (A supplier offering the discount will record the discounts taken by its customers in the account Sales Discounts.) Purchase Discounts is also a general ledger account used by a company purchasing inventory goods and accounting for them under the periodic inventory system.",
    "Example of Purchase Discount": "Assume that a company receives a supplier’s invoice of $5,000 with the credit terms 2/10 net 30. The company will be allowed to subtract a purchase discount of $100 (2% of $5,000) and remit $4,900 if the invoice is paid in 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay the full $5,000 within 30 days. If a company purchases office equipment for $20,000 and the invoice has credit terms of 1/10, net 30, the company can deduct $200 (1% of $20,000) and remit $19,800 if the invoice is paid within 10 days. If that occurs, the company will record the equipment at its cost of $19,800.",
    "Definition of T-Account": "A T-account is a visual aid used to depict a general ledger account. The account title is written above the horizontal part of the “T”. On the left-side of the vertical line, the debit amounts are shown. On the right-side the credit amounts are shown.",
    "Examples for Using T-Accounts": "I regularly use T-accounts when preparing adjusting entries (accruals and deferrals). I begin by drawing two T-accounts, marking one as the balance sheet account, and one as the income statement account. I then enter the current balances. The next step is to determine the amount that should be the correct ending balance for the balance sheet account. The difference between the current balance and the needed ending balance is the amount for the adjusting entry. As a young accountant I had to determine the effect of a new FASB standard on my employer’s financial statements. I reported on the impact on the company’s expenses in great detail. I thought I was done until the controller drew two T-accounts on a piece of paper and noted my comments in the expense T-account, and then asked, “What about the other account? You told me about the expense account, but what other account or accounts are involved? You know we have double-entry accounting!” Thanks to his two T-accounts, I have never forgotten to consider the full impact of business transactions.",
    "Example of a Trial Balance": "Today’s accounting software can print a trial balance at the click of a mouse. Further, a computerized accounting system has eliminated the many math and clerical errors that had occurred with a manual accounting system. Of course, a trial balance that has the total debits equal to the total credits does not mean that the general ledger is free of errors. For instance, recording a debit entry into the Equipment account instead of recording the debit in the Equipment Repairs Account will not be uncovered by the trial balance.",
    "Reasons for Negative Current Liabilities on a Balance Sheet": "Some older accounting software used minus signs or parentheses to indicate credit balances, while positive numbers indicated debit balances. The accounting software usually had an option to print the liability account balances on the balance sheet without the negative signs. If only one liability account has a negative sign, it is likely that the liability account has a debit balance instead of the normal credit balance. This would be the case if a company remitted more than the amount needed.  During the first few days of the accounting period in which reversing entries are recorded to reverse the accrual adjusting entries for expenses and liabilities of the previous period, the current liability accounts will show debit balances. However, that is a temporary situation until the actual bills are processed.",
    "Suspense Account in the Chart of Accounts": "A suspense account could be located in any one of these sections of an organization’s chart of accounts:",
    "Examples of Suspense Accounts": "Assume that a company receives cash of $500 but cannot readily determine the reason why it received the $500. Obviously, the company’s asset Cash is to be debited, but the account to be credited (required by the double-entry system) for $500 is not known. The unknown account could be in any of the following sections of the chart of accounts:",
    "Definition of a/c": "In accounting, a/c is the abbreviation for account.",
    "Example of a/c": "An accountant might leave the following note for a subordinate:\n“Please review the balance in the a/c Interest Payable.”",
    "Definition of Accrued Rent": "Accrued rent is the amount of rent that has not yet been paid by the tenant or received by the landlord for a past period of time. [If the tenant always pays the monthly rent on the first day of every month, there will never be any accrued rent.] Under the accrual method of accounting the tenant should report:",
    "Example of Accrued Rent": "A landlord and tenant agree to a monthly rent of $1,000 for office space beginning on October 1. Each month’s rent is to be paid on the first day of the month. The tenant paid the monthly rent on October 1 and November 1, but asked the landlord if the December rent could be paid on February 1 (when the tenant will be receiving a large payment from a client). The landlord is assured that all rent due will be paid by February 1. Assuming that the tenant and the landlord use the accrual method of accounting, the following accrual adjusting entries are needed prior to issuing the December 31 financial statements:",
    "Definition of a Fully Depreciated Car": "A fully depreciated car is one where the car’s historical cost has already been allocated to expense (except for the estimated salvage value, if any).",
    "Accounting Entries for a Fully Depreciated Car": "If the fully depreciated car continues to be used, there will be no further depreciation. The company cannot depreciate more than the car’s cost.  If the fully depreciated car is sold or scrapped, the following accounting entry is needed:",
    "Definition of a Post-dated Check": "A post-dated check (or post-dated cheque) is a check written with a future date. In other words, the date that appears on the check is after the date when the check was written. Even with a future date appearing on the check, the check could clear (be paid from) the bank account prior to that date. Post-dating a check makes sense only if you are certain that the payee will not cash or deposit the check before the date appearing on the check.",
    "Example of a Post-dated Check": "To illustrate, let’s assume that on May 22 Jim owes a supplier $2,000 for purchases made 40 days ago. Since Jim does not have the money to pay the supplier, he offers to mail the supplier two $1,000 checks: one check dated for June 20 and the other check dated for July 20.  The supplier agrees to hold the checks and deposit them on the dates shown on the checks. Jim assures the supplier that the checks will be paid by his bank on those dates. On June 4, when the supplier receives Jim’s postdated checks, the supplier should not debit cash nor credit accounts receivable. The reason is that the checks cannot be turned into cash prior to the dates shown on the checks.",
    "Definition of Adjusting Entries": "Adjusting entries are usually made on the last day of an accounting period (year, quarter, month) so that a company’s financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting. In other words, the adjusting entries are needed so that a company’s:",
    "Examples of Adjusting Entries": "Here are a few examples of the need for adjusting entries:",
    "Definition of Correcting Entries": "Correcting entries are journal entries made to correct an error in a previously recorded transaction. Correcting entries can involve any combination of income statement accounts and balance sheet accounts.",
    "Examples of Correcting Entries": "The following are two examples of the need for correcting entries:",
    "Definition of Memorandum Entry": "A memorandum entry is a short message entered into the general journal and also entered into a general ledger account. It is not a complete journal entry because it does not contain debit and credit amounts.",
    "Example of Memorandum Entry": "The following entry for a stock split is an example of a memorandum entry:\n“On June 7, 2023 a 2-for-1 stock split was declared for the common stockholders of record as of the end of the day on June 28, 2023. The stock split will result in the number of issued and outstanding shares of common shares increasing from 200,000 shares to 400,000 shares.” Since a stock split does not change the balance in the Common Stock account, a complete journal entry was not required. The memorandum entry merely notes for future reference that the number of shares of stock has changed.",
    "Definition of Understated": "In accounting, understated means that a reported amount is less than the actual, true amount based on the accounting rules. In other words, the reported amount can be described as:",
    "Example of Understated": "Assume that a company reports its accounts payable as $210,000. Also assume that the correct/actual/true amount of accounts payable is $230,000. In this situation, an accountant will say that the reported amount of accounts payable is understated by $20,000. In a double-entry accounting system, the amount in another account will also be understated by $20,000. If the $20,000 understatement is determined to be a misplaced invoice from a marketing consultant, the company’s Marketing Consultants Expense will be the account that is understated by $20,000. As a result of the $20,000 understatement, the company’s income statement will report too little of SG&A expenses, and too much net income. The company’s balance sheet will report too little in accounts payable and too much in owner’s (or stockholders’) equity.",
    "Definition of Outstanding Checks": "Outstanding checks are checks written by the company, recorded in the company accounts, but not yet appearing on the bank account as paid.",
    "Example of Outstanding Checks": "When the company prepares a bank reconciliation, the  outstanding checks are subtracted from the bank statement balance in order to determine the correct or adjusted bank balance. There is no need for the company to write a journal entry, as the checks were recorded in the company’s general ledger account when the checks were written. However, if a company voids one of its outstanding checks, the company will need to make an entry in its general ledger. The entry will debit Cash in order to increase the account balance. The credit portion of the entry will likely be to the account that was originally debited when the check was issued. The check that was voided is also removed from the list of outstanding checks.",
    "Definition of Working Capital": "Working capital is defined as the amount of a company’s current assets minus the amount of its current liabilities usually as of the final moment of an accounting period.",
    "How Working Capital Can be Improved": "Some of the ways that working capital can be increased include:",
    "Definition of Land": "The land that is used in a business (as opposed to land that is an investment, or land that will be sold by a real estate developer) is a tangible asset that is assumed to have an unlimited life. Therefore, the cost of the land is not depreciated. The land used in a business will be reported on the company’s balance sheet under the asset heading of property, plant and equipment. ",
    "Example of Land": "Assume that a company purchases a warehouse for its business operations. The warehouse was built on a 10-acre parcel of land that is included in the property’s cost of $1,600,000. A real estate appraisal indicates that the land has a current value of $400,000 and the warehouse building has a current value of $1,200,000. The transaction will be recorded with a debit of $400,000 to the asset Land, and a debit of $1,200,000 to the asset Warehouse Building. The $400,000 allocated cost of the land is not depreciated, while the warehouse building’s allocated costs of $1,200,000 will be depreciated over the warehouse building’s years of useful life.",
    "Definition of Contra-Liability Account": "A contra-liability account is a liability account in which the balance is expected to be a debit balance. Since a debit balance in a liability account is contrary to the normal credit balance, the account is referred to as a contra-liability account.",
    "Examples of Contra-Liability Accounts": "Some contra-liability accounts include:",
    "Definition of Down Payment on a Contract": "A down payment on a signed contract means a company has received money in advance of doing the work specified in the contract. As for the accounting, the company must record the money in its Cash account and a liability for the money received in advance of doing the work. (The contract without the money is a commitment, but is not recorded in the accounts as a liability.)",
    "Example of a Down Payment on a Contract": "Assume that TOPCO signs a contract to construct a special machine for one of its customers. The contract requires the customer to pay TOPCO $5,000 when the contract is signed and the remainder of $20,000 to be paid when TOPCO delivers the machine within 30 days of the signing. When TOPCO receives the $5,000 down payment, it records the following:",
    "Definition of Money from Insurance Claim for Inventory Loss": "Let’s assume that a company has insurance on its inventory and its inventory is destroyed by a fire in the company’s warehouse. The insurance policy states the insured company will be paid the cost of the inventory lost minus the amount of the insurance policy deductible.",
    "Example of Recording Insurance Claim for Inventory Loss": "Assume that a company received $105,000 from its insurance company as a settlement for the inventory lost in a fire. The inventory lost in the fire is in the company’s general ledger accounts at a cost of $106,000. The insurance policy deductible was $1,000 per occurrence.  The journal entry for this transaction is:",
    "Definition of Recurring Journal Entry": "A recurring journal entry is a journal entry that is recorded in every accounting period. Some recurring journal entries will involve the same accounts and amounts each month. Other recurring entries will involve the same accounts, but with differing amounts. Recurring journal entries may also be referred to as memorized journal entries or standard journal entries. ",
    "Examples of Recurring Journal Entries": "A company that prepares monthly financial statements uses recurring journal entries to record the same monthly amount of depreciation. The entry debits Depreciation Expense for $3,000 and credits Accumulated Depreciation for $3,000 each and every month.  A company may also have recurring journal entries in which the accounts are identical but the amounts vary each month. For example, the company’s payroll entry will have the same accounts but different amounts due to the number of employees and/or the number of hours worked. Other examples of recurring entries with amounts that differ each period include sales, interest earned, interest expense, bank service charges, and others.",
    "Definition of Expenses Credited": "Normally, the general ledger accounts for expenses are debited and are expected to have debit balances. The reason they are debited is they cause the normal credit balance of stockholders’ (owner’s) equity to decrease. However, there are occasions when the general ledger expense accounts will be credited.",
    "Examples of Expenses being Credited": "Below are some examples of when general ledger expense accounts are credited:",
    "Definition of Income Statement and Balance Sheet Accounts": "A company’s general ledger accounts are arranged into two categories based on the financial statement where their amounts are reported:",
    "Examples of Accounts Affected by Transactions": "Most transactions typically affect either of the following:",
    "Definition of Double-Entry Bookkeeping": "Double-entry bookkeeping refers to the 500-year-old system in which each financial transaction of a company is recorded with an entry into at least two of its general ledger accounts. At least one account will have an amount entered as a debit and at least one account will have an amount entered as a credit. Further, the total amounts entered as debits must be equal to the total amounts entered as credits. Meeting these requirements will result in the accounting or bookkeeping equation being in balance at all times.",
    "Examples of Double-Entry Bookkeeping": "Let’s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company’s asset account Cash is increased with a debit entry of $10,000 and the company’s liability account Loans Payable is increased with a credit entry of $10,000. If the company repays $3,000 of the amount borrowed, the company will decrease the amount in its Cash account with a credit entry of $3,000 and will reduce the balance in its Loan Payable account with a debit entry of $3,000. If the company pays its monthly rent of $2,000, a credit entry of $2,000 will be recorded in its Cash account and a $2,000 debit entry will be recorded in its Rent Expense account. If a company collects $500 from a customer who had previously purchased goods on credit, the company will make a debit entry of $500 in its Cash account and will make a credit entry of $500 in its asset account Accounts Receivable.",
    "Definition of Dr.": "In accounting, dr. is the abbreviation for the Italian term used more than 500 years ago to indicate today’s term debit. In accounting and bookkeeping, debit or dr. indicates an entry on the left side of a general ledger account or the left side of a T-account.",
    "Example of Dr.": "Typically, the general ledger accounts for assets and expenses will have debit (dr.) balances and the balances in the asset accounts will be increased with debit amounts. A debit (dr.) will also reduce the credit balances typically found in the revenue, liability, and stockholders’ equity accounts.",
    "Definition of Wages Payable": "Wages payable refers to the wages that a company’s employees have earned, but have not yet been paid. Under the accrual method of accounting, this amount is likely recorded with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period so that the company’s balance sheet will include the amount as a current liability. (The adjusting entry typically debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable.)",
    "Example of Wages Payable": "To illustrate wages payable we will use the following hypothetical dates and other information. Jane is an hourly-paid sales clerk at a company that ends its accounting year on December 31. During the work week of Sunday December 22 through Saturday December 28 Jane earned $400 of wages that the company will pay to her on January 2. For the last three days of the year (December 29-31) Jane earned $160. This amount (plus any wages she earns from January 1-4) will be included in her January 9 paycheck. Given this information, the company has wages payable of $560 ($400 + $160) as of December 31.",
    "Reporting Wages Payable on the Balance Sheet": "The company’s current liabilities on its December 31 balance sheet must include the $560 of wages payable that Jane had earned and the company owes as of December 31. (The company’s income statement for the year that ends on December 31 must also report the $560  as part of its wages expense.) The amount in the account Wages Payable (or Accrued Wages Payable) will often be reported on the balance sheet as part of a current liability description such as accrued compensation, accrued payroll liabilities, accrued expenses, accrued liabilities, etc.  ",
    "Definition of Invoice": "An invoice is a dated bill prepared by the seller of goods sold (or services provided) which includes brief descriptions of the items, quantities of items and their unit prices, extensions (quantities X prices), the total amount, and the payment terms. ",
    "Examples of an Invoice": "The seller refers to the invoice it prepares as a sales invoice. The purchaser of the goods or services will refer to the seller’s sales invoice that it receives as a vendor invoice or purchase invoice.",
    "Definition of a Special Journal": "A special journal (also known as a specialized journal) is useful in a manual accounting or bookkeeping system to reduce the tedious task of recording both the debit and credit general ledger account names and amounts in a general journal.",
    "Example of a Special Journal": "One example of a special journal is the sales journal which is used exclusively for a company’s sales of merchandise to customers that are allowed to pay at a future date. The sales journal will have only one column in which to enter the amount of each sales invoice. At the end of the month the total of the column is debited to Accounts Receivable and credited to Sales. Throughout the month, the individual sales invoices will be posted to each customer’s record found in the company’s subsidiary ledger for Accounts Receivable.   The benefits of using a special journal instead of the general journal for the repetitive transactions have been eliminated with today’s inexpensive yet powerful accounting software. For example, when a sales invoice is prepared by using accounting software, both the general ledger and subsidiary accounts will be updated instantly and accurately.",
    "More Examples of Special Journals": "In addition to the sales journal (used for recording sales on credit), there are other special journals which were popular in manual accounting systems. The following special journals were more efficient than recording all transactions in the general journal:",
    "Definition of Reclassify an Amount": "To reclassify an amount likely means to move an amount from one general ledger account to another general ledger account.",
    "Example of Reclassifying an Amount": "Assume that a company’s accountant recorded a vendor’s invoice for $900 in the account Advertising Expenses. Upon review, the advertising manager informs the accountant that the amount should have been recorded in the account Marketing Supplies. If the accountant uses a journal entry to move the amount, the entry’s description might be: To reclassify $900 from Advertising Expense to Marketing Supplies. The term reclassify has a gentler tone than the phrase to correct an account coding error.",
    "Definition of Adjunct Account": "An adjunct account is a general ledger account that is related to another general ledger account. The combination of the balance in the adjunct account and the other general ledger account is the carrying amount or book value of the main account. An adjunct account might be referred to as a valuation account. ",
    "Example of Adjunct Account": "Assume that a corporation issued bonds with a maturity value of $2,000,000 but investors paid the corporation $2,100,000 because of the bonds’ favorable interest rate. The corporation will record the transaction with a credit to the liability account Bonds Payable for $2,000,000, a credit to the related adjunct liability account Premium on Bonds Payable for $100,000, and a debit to Cash for $2,100,000. At the time the bonds are issued, they  have a carrying amount or book value of $2,100,000. (The corporation will then  amortize the Premium on Bonds Payable to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds.) ",
    "Examples of a Contra Account": "Assume that a company’s Equipment has a debit balance of $450,000. The related account Accumulated Depreciation of Equipment has a credit balance of $190,000. Therefore, the carrying amount or book value of the equipment is $260,000.   Assume a company has sold goods on credit for $900,000. As a result, its Sales account was credited for $900,000 and Accounts Receivable was debited for $900,000. Several customers were disappointed in the goods they received and the company gave them a sales allowance of $10,000. In order to account for such allowances, the company will debit the contra sales account Sales Allowances for $10,000 (instead of debiting Sales) and credits Accounts Receivable. The company will likely combine the credit balance of $900,000 in the Sales account with the debit balance of $10,000 in the Sales Allowances account and report net sales of $890,000.",
    "Definition of Petty Cash Fund": "A petty cash fund is a small amount of money available to pay small amounts without requiring the processing of a business check.",
    "Example of Starting a Petty Cash Fund": "If a company wants to start a petty cash fund, a new general ledger account entitled Petty Cash must be opened. (This will be an additional cash account that can be listed separately on the company’s balance sheet or its balance could be included with the balances in the other cash accounts.) Next, a company check is prepared and cashed for the amount the company believes will be best for the small payments it experiences. If the amount is $100, the company check will be coded to debit Petty Cash for $100 and to credit Cash for $100. One person should be designated to be the petty cash custodian. This person’s name will be listed as the payee on the company’s $100 check and will be accountable for the $100. At all times the custodian must have a combination of cash and petty cash vouchers/receipts which add up to $100. This is referred to as an imprest petty cash fund. Whenever the cash in the petty cash fund is low and just prior to issuing financial statements, the petty cash custodian should request cash for the petty cash receipts, which should be the amount to return the cash amount back to $100. This is known as replenishing the petty cash fund.",
    "Definition of Purchases and Inventory": "When a company uses the periodic inventory system the amount of the company’s inventory is determined by a physical count at the end of the accounting year. Throughout the year the general ledger account Inventory is dormant and contains only the cost of the prior year’s ending inventory. With the periodic inventory system, the costs of additional purchases of goods are debited to the temporary account Purchases. (There will also be temporary accounts that will be credited for Purchase Returns and Allowances and for Purchase Discounts.) When a company uses the perpetual inventory system, the general ledger account Inventory is continually being updated for all the purchases and sales of goods:",
    "Definition of Post-Closing Trial Balance": "The total amounts on a post-closing trial balance show that the accounts having debit balances = the accounts having credit balances.",
    "Example of Balance Sheet Totals": "Assets normally have debit balances. However, there are a few asset accounts that are expected to have credit balances. (These are known as contra asset accounts.) One example is Accumulated Depreciation. Let’s assume that a company has property, plant and equipment with a cost of $200,000. The accumulated depreciation associated with these assets is $130,000. Therefore, the total assets reported on the balance sheet will report the net amount of $70,000.",
    "Example of Post-closing Trial Balance Totals": "Using the amounts above, the company’s post-closing trial balance will report $200,000 in the debit column and $130,000 in the credit column. This will cause a difference of $130,000 between the balance sheet totals and the post-closing trial balance totals. Other examples of contra accounts that will result in the balance sheet totals being different from the post-closing trial balance totals include:",
    "Definition of Asset Account Balances": "In accounting, asset accounts normally have debit balances. That is, the general ledger accounts for assets typically have their balances on the left side. This is also the case with T-accounts and is consistent with the accounting equation ( Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity) where the asset account balances are on the left side. However, there are a few general ledger asset accounts that must have credit balances. These accounts are known as contra asset accounts since their credit balances are contrary to the usual debit balances found in most asset accounts.",
    "Examples of Asset Accounts with Credit Balances": "Two examples of contra asset accounts are:",
    "Definition of Transposition Error": "A transposition error occurs when an amount is recorded incorrectly as the result of switching the positions of two (or more) digits. The switching of the positions causes a difference (between the recorded amount and the correct amount) that will be evenly divisible by 9.",
    "Examples of Transposition Errors": "For example, if 986 was the correct amount, but it was recorded incorrectly as 968, the difference between the two amounts is 18. Since this difference is evenly divisible by 9 (18 divided by 9 = exactly 2), the mistake is described as a transposition error. Another example of the many possible transposition errors is recording 3662 as 3626. In this situation, the difference between the correct and incorrect amounts is 36. Because the difference is evenly divisible by 9 (36 divided by 9 = exactly 4), this indicates that the error could be the result of transposing digits.",
    "Determining Whether a Transposition Error Was Involved": "If you are faced with finding a difference between two amounts, you might save some time by first dividing the difference by 9. (A few differences that are evenly divisible by 9 include: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, etc.) Knowing that the error could be a transposition error may lead you to first review the more relevant amounts.",
    "Definition of Discount on Purchase of Office Furniture": "The discount on the purchase of office furniture that will be used by a company (as opposed to being resold by a furniture retailer) is recorded in the same asset account in which the office furniture is recorded, such as Furniture and Fixtures or Office Furniture. In other words, the discount is a reduction of the asset’s cost. [If the discount is received by a retailer who is in the business of buying and selling office furniture, the discount is likely recorded in the general ledger account Purchase Discounts.]",
    "Example of Discount on Purchase of Office Furniture": "Assume that a company purchases furniture for the office of a newly appointed executive. The cost of the furniture is $10,000 and the invoice allows an early payment discount of 1% if it is paid within 10 days. If the company pays the invoice within 10 days, the Furniture and Fixtures account will increase by $9,900 ($10,000 minus the discount of $100). The depreciation calculations will be based on the cost of $9,900.",
    "Definition of Invoice Payment Terms": "Invoice payment terms appear as part of the information shown on the invoice (or bill) prepared by a seller of goods or a provider of services. Generally, the invoice is prenumbered and the seller adds the purchaser’s name, address, when the invoice is to be paid, a detailed listing of the goods and/or services, the amount owed for each item, and the total amount of the invoice. Some common invoice payment terms are:",
    "Example of Invoice Payment Terms": "Assume that SalesMax shipped 100 units of Product Z to GoodCorp with a selling price of $12 a unit. SalesMax sends GoodCorp an invoice listing the items, the date shipped of June 15, and payment terms of 2/10, net 30. When GoodCorp receives the 100 units of product, it discovers that 5 of the units were defective. After informing SalesMax, SalesMax issued a credit memo for $60 (5 units X $12) and asks GoodCorp to destroy or donate the 5 units. SalesMax will record the $60 credit memo by debiting Sales Returns and Allowances for $60 and crediting Accounts Receivable by $60. GoodCorp will record the credit memo by debiting Accounts Payable for $60 and crediting Purchase Returns and Allowances (or Inventory) for $60. If GoodCorp pays SalesMax by June 25, GoodCorp will record the payment as follows:",
    "Definition of Notes Payable": "In accounting, Notes Payable is a general ledger liability account in which a company records the face amounts of the promissory notes that it has issued. The balance in Notes Payable represents the amounts that remain to be paid. Since a note payable will require the issuer/borrower to pay interest, the issuing company will have interest expense. Under the accrual method of accounting, the company will also have another liability account entitled Interest Payable. In this account the company records the interest that it has incurred but has not paid as of the end of the accounting period. For most companies the amounts in Notes Payable and Interest Payable are reported on the balance sheet as follows:",
    "Example of a Note Payable": "If a company borrows money from its bank, the bank will require the company’s officers to sign a formal loan agreement before the bank provides the money. The company will record this loan in its general ledger account, Notes Payable. In addition to the formal promise, some loans require collateral to reduce the bank’s risk.",
    "Definition of Account Payable": "The account Accounts Payable is normally a current liability used to record purchases on credit from a company’s suppliers. In this situation there is no formal written promise to pay.",
    "Examples of Accounts Payable": "When someone uses the term accounts payable the person may be referring to any of the following:",
    "Example of Accumulated Depreciation": "Let’s assume that at the beginning of the current year a company’s asset account Equipment reported a cost of $70,000. From the time the equipment was put into service until the beginning of the year the related Accumulated Depreciation account shows a credit balance of $45,000. During the current year the company debits Depreciation Expense for $10,000 and credits Accumulated Depreciation for $10,000. Therefore, at the end of the current year the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation is $55,000. By crediting the account Accumulated Depreciation instead of crediting the Equipment account, the balance sheet at the end of the year can easily report both the equipment’s cost of $70,000 and its accumulated depreciation of $55,000, the net of which is $15,000. This is more informative than reporting only the net amount of $15,000 (which would likely be the case if the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation was not used).",
    "Examples on Notes Payable": "Notes payable are required when a company borrows money from a bank or other lender. Notes payable may also be part of a transaction to acquire expensive equipment. In certain cases, a supplier will require a note payable instead of terms such as net 30 days. ",
    "Definition of Income Tax": "In the accounting for a regular U.S. corporation, income tax usually refers to the federal, state, local, and foreign countries’ taxes that are levied based on a corporation’s taxable income. The taxable income and the related income tax are found on the corporation’s income tax return. (The corporation’s taxable income is based on the income tax laws and regulations of the various governments.) The accounting and financial reporting of a regular corporation’s income taxes is complicated because the accounting principles are likely to be different from the income tax laws and regulations. Generally, a profitable regular corporation’s financial statements will report both income tax expense and a current liability such as income taxes payable.",
    "Examples of Income Tax Expense and Income Taxes Payable": "A profitable corporation’s financial statements will report:",
    "Definition of Cash Discount": "A cash discount is a deduction allowed by some sellers of goods or by some providers of services to motivate customers to pay within an earlier specified time. The cash discount is also referred to as an early payment discount. The sellers and providers offering a cash discount will refer to it as a sales discount, while the buyer will refer to the same discount as a purchase discount. ",
    "Examples of a Cash Discount": "Let’s assume that a company offers a cash discount and it is printed on its sales invoices as 1/10, net 30. Let’s also assume that a sales invoice is for $1,000 and the buyer has been authorized to return $100 of goods. Therefore, the net amount due to the seller within 30 days is $900. However, the buyer may deduct $9 (1% of $900) if the buyer pays the seller $891 within 10 days of the invoice date. The seller will usually record the $9 cash discount with a debit to the account Sales Discounts. The buyer will record the $9 savings as a credit to Purchase Discounts or as a reduction to the cost recorded in inventory. My dentist offers a 5% cash discount if the dental fee is paid on the day of the service. This discount is offered to avoid the expenses of billing, mailing statements for unpaid amounts, processing partial payments, not collecting amounts owed, etc. The dentist and others accept credit card payments and pay a fee to a credit card processor in order to avoid similar expenses.",
    "Definition of Accounts Receivables": "Accounts receivable are usually current assets that result from selling goods or providing services to customers on credit. Accounts receivable are also known as trade receivables.",
    "Definition of Receivables": "The term receivables sometimes refers to a company’s accounts receivables. However, the term receivables could include both trade receivables and nontrade receivables. Nontrade receivables exclude accounts receivable and may appear on the balance sheet as other receivables.",
    "Examples of Nontrade Receivables": "Some examples of nontrade or other receivables include:",
    "Definition of Purchase Return": "A purchase return occurs when a buyer returns merchandise that it had purchased from a supplier. Since the return of purchased merchandise is time consuming and costly, under the periodic inventory system there will be an account Purchases Returns. This allows the company’s management to see the magnitude of the returns that occurred. The account Purchases Returns is a general ledger account that will have a credit balance (or no balance). Its credit balance will offset the debit balance in the Purchases account. ",
    "Example of a Purchase Return": "Let’s assume that a company using the periodic inventory system, purchased merchandise having a cost of $1,000 with terms of net 30 days. This was recorded with:",
    "Definition of Responsibility Accounting": "Responsibility accounting involves the internal accounting and budgeting for each responsibility center within a company. The objective of responsibility accounting is to assist in the planning and control of a company’s responsibility centers.",
    "Example of Responsibility Accounting": "Typically each decentralized department and division within a company will receive a monthly report showing its budgeted and actual amounts for the most recent month as well as the year-to-date budgeted and actual amounts.",
    "Definition of Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense": "Deferred expense and prepaid expense both refer to a payment that was made, but due to the matching principle, the amount will not become an expense until one or more future accounting periods. Most of these payments will be recorded as assets until the appropriate future period or periods. Sometimes these amounts are referred to as prepayments. Before a balance sheet is prepared, the accountant must review the deferrals/prepaids and move the appropriate amounts to expense.",
    "Difference between Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense": "It appears that most accountants refer to the deferrals that will become expenses within one year of the balance sheet as prepaid expenses. The amount that has not been expensed as of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current asset. The deferred expenses that will not become expenses within one year of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the long-term asset section of the balance sheet under the classification of other assets. (An exception is the costs of issuing long-term bonds. This amount is reported on the balance sheet as a contra liability account along with Bonds Payable in the long-term liability section.)",
    "Definition of Owner’s Draws": "Owner’s draws are withdrawals of a sole proprietorship’s cash or other assets made by the owner for the owner’s personal use. The account in which the draws are recorded is a contra owner’s capital account or contra owner’s equity account since its debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance of the owner’s equity or capital account. The title of the account for recording R. Smith’s draws from his or her business is R. Smith, Drawing or R. Smith, Withdrawals. This account is a temporary account because its balance will be closed at the end of each year. However, the account’s debit balance is closed directly to the owner’s capital account. (The owner’s draws are not reported as an expense on the company’s income statement.) ",
    "Example of Owner’s Draws": "Let’s assume that R. Smith, the owner of a sole proprietorship, withdraws $2,000 each month for the owner’s household expenses. The company’s entry to record each month’s draws will be:",
    "Definition of Reclassification": "In accounting, the term reclassification is often used to describe moving an amount from one general ledger account to another. ",
    "Examples of Reclassification": "Assume that a repair bill of $5,000 was initially debited to the asset account Equipment. Since the repair was not an improvement nor did it extend the life of the equipment, the controller prepared a journal entry that debits Repairs Expense for $5,000 and credits Equipment for $5,000. The description on the controller’s journal entry was, “To reclassify the XYZ Co.’s repair bill from Equipment to Repairs Expense.” Reclassification can also be used to describe moving a note payable from a long-term liability account to a short-term or current liability account when the note’s maturity date is less than one year away. Another example of reclassification arises when a company stops using one of its buildings and puts the building up for sale. In that situation, the journal entry description might be, “To reclassify the X building from property, plant and equipment to long-term investments.”",
    "Definition of Goods Purchased by a Retailer": "The goods purchased by a retailer are the products or merchandise that it buys and plans to resell. The goods that are sold during the accounting period must be reported on the retailer’s income statement as the cost of goods sold.  The goods that are unsold at the end of the accounting period must be reported on the retailer’s balance sheet as inventory.",
    "Accounting for the Goods Purchased": "There are two ways to record the goods at the time the goods are purchased:",
    "Examples of Accounting for Goods Purchased": "Assume that a retailer begins the year with inventory having a cost of $800. It ends the year with inventory having a cost of $900. During the year the retailer purchased goods at a cost of $7,000. Let’s also assume that the cost per unit did not change during the year. If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an expense (cost of goods sold), then at the end of the year the retailer’s adjusting entry must debit Inventory for $100 (since the inventory has increased from $800 to $900). The other account in this adjusting entry is the expense Cost of Goods Sold which is credited for $100. As a result, the income statement will report the cost of goods sold at $6,900 ($7,000 minus the $100 credit). The balance sheet will report inventory of $900 ($800 plus the debit of $100). If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an asset, the Inventory account balance increases from $800 to $7,800. Since the actual inventory at the end of the year is $900, the adjusting entry must credit Inventory for $6,900 ($7,800 minus $900) and debit Cost of Goods Sold for $6,900. Regardless of whether the goods purchased were initially recorded as an expense or as an asset, the amounts must be adjusted so that the financial statements report the expense (reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement for the year) at $6,900 and the asset inventory (reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the year) at $900.",
    "Examples of Two Methods for Recording Prepaid Expenses": "One method for recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in an asset account. For example, assume that on December 1 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for 6 months of liability insurance coverage:",
    "Definition of Purchase Allowance": "A purchase allowance is a reduction in the buyer’s cost of merchandise that had been purchased. The purchase allowance is granted by the supplier because of a problem such as shipping the wrong items, an incorrect quantity, flaws in the goods, etc. In the case of a purchase allowance, the buyer does not return the merchandise to the supplier.",
    "Example of a Purchase Allowance": "A retailer ordered 10 items at a cost of $15 each from one of its suppliers. A week after receiving the items, the retailer discovered that one of the items had a flaw. When the retailer notified the supplier, the supplier requested that the retailer donate or discard the item and the supplier will issue a credit memo for $15. Under a periodic inventory system, the retailer will record the supplier’s credit memo with 1) a credit of $15 to the account Purchase Allowances or to the account Purchase Returns and Allowances, and 2) a debit of $15 to Accounts Payable. The retailer will combine the debit balance in its Purchases account with the credit balance in Purchase Allowances to arrive at the retailer’s net purchases. The supplier records the credit memo with a debit to Sales Allowances and a credit to Accounts Receivable. The supplier will combine the debit balance in its Sales Allowances account with the credit balance in its Sales account to arrive at its net sales.",
    "Definition of Contra Expense Account": "A contra expense account is a general ledger expense account that will intentionally have a credit balance (instead of the debit balance that is typical for an expense account). In other words, this account’s credit balance is contrary to (or opposite of) the usual debit balance for an expense account. Another description of a contra expense account is an account that reduces or offsets the amounts reported in another general ledger expense account(s).",
    "Example of Contra Expense Account": "Assume that a company uses a contra expense account to record the amounts that employees paid toward the company’s health insurance costs. For instance, the company might debit its expense account 4210 Employee Health Insurance Expense when recording the insurance company’s invoice of $10,000. If the company withholds $2,000 from its employees’ wages to pay part of the cost of the insurance, the company will credit its contra expense account 4211 Employee Withholdings for Health Ins. The benefit of using the contra expense account is that the company’s managers can see in account 4210 the total amount that the company paid to the health insurance company. Then in account 4211 they can see the portion of the cost that was paid by the employees. The company’s income statement will report the combination of the amounts in accounts 4210 and 4211 in order to show the company’s actual expense of $8,000 ($10,000 minus $2,000).",
    "Reporting Petty Cash on the Financial Statements": "The petty cash amount may appear as the first or second item listed in the current asset section of the balance sheet.   However, the petty cash amount might be combined with the balances in the other cash accounts and their total reported as Cash or as Cash and cash equivalents as the first current asset.",
    "Definition of Valuation Account": "In accounting, a valuation account is usually a balance sheet account that is used in combination with another balance sheet account in order to report the carrying amount or carrying value of an asset or liability. The benefit of a valuation account is that the amount in the main account is not changed, since the needed adjustment(s) are contained in a separate account.",
    "Examples of Valuation Accounts": "A common example of a valuation account is the contra account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, which is associated with the balance sheet account Accounts Receivable.  The combination of the credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is the net realizable value of the company’s accounts receivable.  Other valuation accounts associated with assets include Discount on Notes Receivable, Accumulated Depreciation, and allowance accounts used with inventory and investments. Two examples of valuation accounts associated with a liabilities are Bond Issue Costs and Discount on Bonds Payable. The debit balances in these valuation accounts will be combined with the credit balance in Bonds Payable in order to report the carrying value or carrying amount of the bonds. Premium on Bonds Payable is a valuation account with a credit balance.",
    "Definition of Deposit on Utilities": "A new customer of a public utility (electricity, natural gas, telephone, etc.) may be required to pay a refundable amount known as a utility deposit or security deposit before the public utility will provide services. After a period of time, the public utility will refund the customer’s utility deposit.",
    "Example of Recording a Deposit on Utilities": "Assume that a new business is required to pay $500 as a security deposit to an electric utility before the utility provides electricity. The deposit will be refunded by the utility after six months of timely payments.  The new business will record the deposit with a $500 debit to the current asset account Utilities Deposits and will credit the asset account Cash for $500. The electric utility will record the customer’s security deposit with a $500 credit to the current liability account Customers’ Security Deposits and will debit its Cash account for $500.",
    "Definition of Capital Surplus": "In the past, capital surplus was used to describe what is now referred to as paid-in capital in excess of par or Premium on Common Stock.",
    "Example of Capital Surplus": "Today, if a corporation issues shares of its common stock and receives more than its par value, two accounts are involved:",
    "Definition of Permanent Account": "In accounting, a permanent account refers to a general ledger account that is not closed at the end of an accounting year. The balance in a permanent account is carried forward to the subsequent year, where it becomes the beginning balance for the new year. Permanent accounts are also known as real accounts.",
    "Examples of Permanent Accounts": "Generally, the balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts, except for the owner’s drawing account which is a balance sheet account and a temporary account. (The owner’s drawing account is a temporary account because its balance is closed to the owner’s capital account at the end of each year in order to begin the next year with a $0 balance.)  Examples of permanent accounts are:",
    "Definition of Net Purchases": "Net purchases refers to the combination of the amounts found in the following general ledger temporary accounts:",
    "Example of Net Purchases": "To illustrate the calculation of net purchases, assume that a company had the following general ledger account balances at the end of its accounting year:",
    "Definition of Depreciation Accounts": "There are two types of general ledger accounts in which depreciation is recorded:",
    "Example of Depreciation Accounts": "Assume a company has equipment which is used in its business. The equipment’s cost was $600,000 and is expected to last for 10 years at which time it will be scrapped for no salvage value. Using the straight-line depreciation method, the monthly depreciation will be $5,000 per month ($600,000/120 months). Therefore, each month for 10 years the company will record the following adjusting entry:",
    "Definition of Wages": "Wages are usually associated with employee compensation that is based on the number of hours worked multiplied by an hourly rate of pay. Generally, the employees earning hourly wages will be paid in the week that follows the hours worked.",
    "Example of Wages": "For example, a warehouse employee works 40 hours during the work week. If the employee’s hourly rate of pay is $15, on the 5th day following the work week, the employee will receive a paycheck showing gross wages of $600 (40 x $15). If the employee had worked only 30 hours during the work week, the paycheck will show gross wages of $450 (30 x $15).",
    "Definition of Salary": "Salary is associated with employee compensation quoted on an annual basis, such as $50,000 per year. Many employees working in a company’s general office will be paid a salary. Often the salaries are paid semi-monthly. That is, one pay date will be the 15th day of the month for working from the 1st to the 15th, and the other pay date will be the last day of the month for working from the 16th to the last day of the month.",
    "Example of Salary": "To illustrate, let’s assume that the manager of a company might earn a salary of $120,000 per year. If the manager is paid semi-monthly each paycheck will show a gross salary of $5,000 for half a month’s work.",
    "Overtime Pay": "U.S. and state law protects employees from having to work more than 40 hours per week when their wages or salary is below a certain level. In other words, a salaried employee with a relatively low annual salary must be given overtime compensation if the person’s hours worked are greater than 40 hours per week. You should be aware of the federal and state laws for your employees’ overtime compensation.",
    "Significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination": "The terms FOB shipping point and FOB destination have significance in accounting because they determine the following:",
    "Example of FOB Shipping Point": "Assume that a seller quoted a price of $900 FOB shipping point and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are in transit until they arrive at the buyer’s location on January 2. On December 30, the seller should record a sale, an account receivable, and a reduction in its inventory. The buyer should record the purchase, the account payable, and the increase in its inventory as of December 30 (the date that the purchase took place). Since the goods on the truck belong to the buyer, the buyer should pay the shipping costs. These shipping costs will be an additional cost of the goods purchased.",
    "Example of FOB Destination": "Now assume that a seller quoted $975 FOB destination and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are on the truck until January 2, when they are unloaded at the buyer’s location. On December 31, the goods were owned by the seller. Therefore, the seller should continue to report these goods in its inventory until January 2. The seller will be responsible for the shipping costs, which will be an expense in January when the sale is reported. The buyer records the purchase, accounts payable, and the increase in inventory on January 2 when the buyer becomes the owner of the goods.",
    "Definition of Three-Way Match": "In the accounting and bookkeeping area of accounts payable, the three-way match refers to a procedure used when processing an invoice received from a vendor or supplier. The purpose of the three-way match is to avoid paying an incorrect and perhaps fraudulent invoice.",
    "Example of Three-Way Match": "The “three-way” part of the three-way match refers to the three documents that will be compared:",
    "Examples of a Liability": "Examples of a liability include:",
    "Definition of Provision for Bad Debts": "The provision for bad debts could refer to the balance sheet account also known as the Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. If so, the account Provision for Bad Debts is a contra asset account (an asset account with a credit balance). It is used along with the account Accounts Receivable in order for the balance sheet to report the net realizable value of the company’s accounts receivable. The entry to increase the credit balance in these contra accounts is a debit to the income statement account Bad Debts Expense. Some companies might use the description provision for bad debts on its income statement in order to report the credit losses that pertain to the period of the income statement. In that case, provision for bad debts would be an income statement account. However, the U.S. accounting textbooks are more likely to use Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense to describe the amount reported on the income statement.",
    "Definition of Credit Memo": "One type of credit memo is issued by a seller in order to reduce the amount that a customer owes from a previously issued sales invoice. Another type of credit memo, or credit memorandum, is issued by a bank when it increases a depositor’s checking account for a certain transaction.",
    "Example of a Credit Memo": "Assume that SellerCorp had issued a sales invoice for $800 for 100 units of product that it shipped to BuyerCo at a price of $8 each. BuyerCo informs SellerCorp that one of the units is defective. SellerCorp will then issue a credit memo for $8. The credit memo will result in the following entry in SellerCorp’s accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Sales Returns and Allowances, and 2) a credit of $8 to Accounts Receivable. In other words, the credit memo reduced SellerCorp’s net sales and its accounts receivable.  When BuyerCo records the credit memo, the following will occur in its accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Accounts Payable, and 2) a credit of $8 to Purchases Returns and Allowances (or to Inventory).",
    "Are Retained Earnings an Asset?": "While the amount of a corporation’s retained earnings is reported in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet, the cash that was generated from those retained earnings is not likely be in the company’s checking account. Instead, the corporation likely used the cash to acquire additional assets in order to generate additional earnings for its stockholders. In some cases, the corporation will use the cash from the retained earnings to reduce its liabilities. As a result, it is difficult to identify exactly where the retained earnings are presently. One can get a sense of how the retained earnings have been used by studying the corporation’s balance sheet and its statement of cash flows.  ",
    "Where do Retained Earnings Come From?": "At the end of an accounting year, the balances in a corporation’s revenue, gain, expense, and loss accounts are used to compute the year’s net income. Those account balances are then transferred to the Retained Earnings account. When the year’s revenues and gains exceed the expenses and losses, the corporation will have a positive net income which causes the balance in the Retained Earnings account to increase. (If the corporation’s revenues and gains for the year are less than the expenses and losses, the result is a net loss that reduces the normal credit balance in the Retained Earnings account.) The balance in the Retained Earnings account is also decreased when the corporation declares a cash dividend. ",
    "What is the Normal Balance in the Retained Earnings Account?": "The normal balance in a profitable corporation’s Retained Earnings account is a credit balance. This is logical since the revenue accounts have credit balances and expense accounts have debit balances. If the balance in the Retained Earnings account has a debit balance, this negative amount of retained earnings may be described as deficit or accumulated deficit.",
    "Definition of Revenue Received in Advance": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability. When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues. As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.",
    "Examples of Revenue Received in Advance": "The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:",
    "Definition of Payment for Insurance": "A company’s property insurance, liability insurance, business interruption insurance, etc. often covers a one-year period with the cost (insurance premiums) paid in advance. The one-year period for the insurance rarely coincides with the company’s accounting year. Therefore, the insurance payments will likely involve more than one annual financial statement and many interim financial statements.",
    "Prepaid Insurance vs. Insurance Expense": "When the insurance premiums are paid in advance, they are referred to as prepaid. The amount of the insurance premiums that remain prepaid at the end of each accounting period are reported in the current asset account, Prepaid Insurance. The balance in this account will be combined with the balances in other prepaid expense accounts and will be listed on the balance sheet as prepaid expenses. As the prepaid amount expires, the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced by a credit to Prepaid Insurance and a debit to Insurance Expense. This is done with an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period (e.g. monthly). One objective of the adjusting entry is to match the proper amount of insurance expense to the period indicated on the income statement.",
    "Example of Payment for Insurance Expense": "Let’s assume that a company is started on December 1 and arranges for business insurance to begin on December 1. On December 1 the company pays the insurance company $12,000 for the insurance premiums covering one year. The company will record the payment with a debit of $12,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $12,000 to Cash. On December 31, the company writes an adjusting entry to record the insurance expense that was used up (expired) and to reduce the amount that remains prepaid. This is accomplished with a debit of $1,000 to Insurance Expense and a credit of $1,000 to Prepaid Insurance. This same adjusting entry will be prepared at the end of each of the next 11 months.",
    "Definition of Journal Entry for Depreciation": "The journal entry for depreciation is:",
    "Purpose of Journal Entry for Depreciation": "The purpose of the journal entry for depreciation is to achieve the matching principle. In each accounting period, part of the cost of certain assets (equipment, building, vehicle, etc.) will be moved from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement. The goal is to match the cost of the asset to the revenues in the accounting periods in which the asset is being used.",
    "More Information on the Depreciation Entry": "It is important to understand the following:",
    "Definition of Sundry": "Sundry can mean various, miscellaneous, or diverse.",
    "Definition of Sundry Debtors": "Sundry debtors could be referring to a company’s customers who rarely make purchases on credit and the amounts are not significant.",
    "Example of Sundry Debtors": "I suspect that the term sundry was more common when bookkeeping was done manually. For instance, prior to the low cost of computers and accounting software, the bookkeeper had to add a page to the company’s subsidiary ledger book for every new customer. Adding a new page for every occasional customer could result in a subsidiary ledger book that was unwieldy. Therefore, it was more practical to have one page entitled sundry  on which those occasional customers’ small transactions were entered. With the efficiency and low cost of today’s accounting systems, the need for classifying customers and accounts as sundry has been eliminated.",
    "Definition of Net Assets": "Net assets is defined as total assets  minus total liabilities.",
    "Examples of Net Assets": "In a sole proprietorship the amount of net assets is reported as owner’s equity. In a corporation the amount of net assets is reported as stockholders’ equity. In a not-for-profit (NFP) organization, the net amount of its total assets minus total liabilities is actually reported as net assets in its statement of financial position. The net assets section for the NFP organization is divided into two major classifications:",
    "Definition of Loan Principal Payment": "When a company borrows money from its bank, the amount received is recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account, such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable, which is reported on the company’s balance sheet. The cash received from the bank loan is referred to as the principal amount. The principal amount received from the bank is not part of a company’s revenues and therefore will not be reported on the company’s income statement. Similarly, any repayment of the principal amount will not be an expense and therefore will not be reported on the income statement. The principal payment is recorded as a reduction of the liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable. (Both the receipt of the loan principal amount and the repayment of the loan principal will be reported on the statement of cash flows.) The interest on the loan will be reported as expense on the income statement in the periods when the interest is incurred.",
    "Example of a Loan Principal Payment": "Let’s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company’s cash increases by $10,000 and its liability Loans Payable increases by $10,000. Let’s also assume that the company makes a payment of $1,000 consisting of $60 for interest and $940 for principal, the entry will be:",
    "Definition of Source Document": "A source document is an original record which contains the detail that supports or substantiates a transaction that will be (or has been) entered in an accounting system. In the past, source documents were printed on paper. Today, the source documents may be an electronic record.",
    "Examples of Source Documents": "A few examples of a company’s source documents include:",
    "Definition of Transportation-in Costs": "Transportation-in costs, which are also known as freight-in costs, are part of the cost of goods purchased. The reason is that accountants define “cost” as all costs necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. If a company purchases goods with terms such as FOB shipping point, the company will be responsible for any costs to get the products from the seller to the company’s warehouse. In that situation, the company using the periodic system will likely have a purchases account entitled Transportation-in or Freight-in. (If goods are purchased with terms of FOB destination, the buyer will not have a separate transportation-in cost, because the seller is responsible for the costs of getting the goods to the buyer’s location.)  Transportation-in costs should be allocated or assigned to the products purchased. Therefore, the unsold products in inventory should include a portion of the transportation-in costs. The products that have been sold, should have their share of the transportation-in costs in the cost of goods sold).",
    "Example of Transportation-in Costs": "Let’s assume that a bookstore purchases 20 copies of a bestselling book for $20 each and the terms are FOB shipping point. The shipping cost to get the books from the publisher to the bookstore amounts to $40. Therefore, this transportation-in cost of $40 amounts to $2 per book, resulting in a cost per book of $22. If 16 books are sold, the cost of goods sold will be $352 (16 X $22) and the inventory cost of the remaining 4 books will be $88 (4 X $22). In total, the bookstore had purchases of $400 + transportation-in cost of $40, resulting in the cost of goods available of $440. When we subtract the $88 cost of inventory, there is $352 as the cost of goods sold.",
    "Definition of an Imprest System of Petty Cash": "An imprest system of petty cash means that the general ledger account Petty Cash will remain dormant at a constant amount. If the amount of petty cash is $100, then the Petty Cash account will always report a debit balance of $100. This $100 is the imprest balance. As long as $100 is adequate for the organization’s small disbursements, then the general ledger account Petty Cash will never be debited or credited again. When the currency and coins on hand gets low, the petty cash custodian will request a check to replenish the coins and currency that were disbursed. Since the requested check is drawn on the organization’s checking account, the Cash account (not the Petty Cash account) will be credited. The debits will go to the expense accounts indicated by the petty cash receipts, such as postage expense, supplies expense. In other words, the general ledger account Petty Cash is not involved in the replenishment. (Replenishment means getting the total of the currency and coins back to the imprest amount.) The petty cash custodian will cash the check and add the amount to the other cash.  Under the imprest system, the petty cash custodian should at all times have a combination of currency, coins, and petty cash receipts that equals $100 (the imprest petty cash balance). Control over the petty cash occurs during the replenishment process. The person approving the check for the petty cash custodian to cash should review the petty cash receipts and attach them to the check request. Control can also occur when an independent person confirms that the petty cash custodian’s cash and receipts adds up to the imprest amount.",
    "Definition of Goods Purchased at a Discount": "There are two common types of discounts for companies buying goods to resell:",
    "Examples of Entries for Goods Purchased at a Discount": "Trade discount. Some suppliers have catalogs with prices before any discounts. Let’s assume that the supplier gives companies that purchase a high volume of goods a trade discount of 30%. A small volume buyer receives only a 10% discount. If a high volume company purchases $40,000 of goods, its cost will be $28,000 ($40,000 X 70%). To comply with the cost principle the company will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $28,000 and will credit Accounts Payable for $28,000. Early payment discount. Some suppliers offer discounts of 1% or 2% from the sales invoice amount, if the invoice is paid in 10 days instead of the usual 30 days. For instance, let’s assume that a company purchases goods and the supplier’s sales invoice is $28,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. This means that the company can deduct $280 (1% of $28,000) if it pays the invoice within 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay $28,000 within 30 days. The early payment discount is also referred to as a purchase discount or cash discount. If the company pays the supplier’s invoice within 10 days, there are two ways to record the early payment discount of $280:",
    "Definition of Bad Debts Expense": "Bad debts expense is related to a company’s current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.",
    "Examples of Bad Debts Expense": "There are two methods for reporting the amount of bad debts expense:",
    "Definition of a Voucher": "A voucher is an internal document used by a company’s accounts payable department in order to collect and organize the necessary documentation and approvals before paying a vendor’s invoice. The voucher acts as a cover page to which the following will be attached: vendor’s invoice, company’s purchase order, company’s receiving report, and other information needed to further process the vendor’s invoice for payment.",
    "Definition of Inventory Account in Periodic Method": "Under the periodic method or periodic system, the account Inventory is dormant throughout the accounting year and will report only the cost of the prior year’s ending inventory. The current year’s purchases are recorded in one or more temporary accounts entitled Purchases. At the end of the accounting year, the beginning balance in the account Inventory must be changed so that it reports the cost (or perhaps lower than the cost) of the ending inventory.",
    "Examples of Adjusting the Inventory Account": "When using the periodic method, balance in the inventory account can be changed to the ending inventory’s cost by recording an adjusting entry. To illustrate, let’s assume that the cost of a company’s beginning inventory (last year’s ending inventory) was $35,000. This balance will be the only amount in the account Inventory until the end of the year. Let’s assume that at the end of the year a physical count of inventory is taken and it has an actual cost of $40,000. To adjust the Inventory account balance from a debit balance of $35,000 to a debit balance of $40,000, the following adjusting entry will be needed:",
    "Definition of Subsidiary Ledger": "A subsidiary ledger contains the details to support a general ledger control account. For instance, the subsidiary ledger for accounts receivable contains the information for each of the company’s credit sales to customers, each customer’s remittance, return of merchandise, discounts, and so on. With these details in the subsidiary ledger, the Accounts Receivable account in the general ledger can report summary amounts for the accounts receivable activity.",
    "Examples of Subsidiary Ledgers": "By having the details of the accounts receivable activity in a subsidiary ledger, employees in a company’s credit department of a company can access the credit sales information without having access to any information in the general ledger. In job order costing systems, the job cost sheets (or job cost records) will serve as the subsidiary ledger containing the details for the general ledger account Work in Process. The Work in Process account will now be a control account containing summary amounts for direct materials, direct labor, factory overhead applied, transfers to finished goods, etc. Manufacturing personnel will have full access to the job cost sheets without having access to other information in the general ledger. Since companies are integrating accounting records with their other information into one database, I assume there will be less use of the term subsidiary ledgers in the future. There will likely be reports generated to provide the information formerly contained in the subsidiary ledger.",
    "Definition of Materiality": "In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000. Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial.  ",
    "Example of Materiality": "A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket. Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.",
    "Definition of Petty Cash Voucher": "A petty cash voucher is usually a small form that is used to document a disbursement (payment) from a petty cash fund. Petty cash vouchers are also referred to as petty cash receipts and can be purchased from office supply stores. The petty cash voucher should provide space for the following:",
    "Example of Petty Cash Voucher": "Shown below is an example of a petty cash voucher. ",
    "Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable": "Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors’ invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.",
    "Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable": "In addition to the amounts associated with vendors’ invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.",
    "Definition of Monthly Close": "In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company’s monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting. Since a company’s business activities are ongoing, accountants might state “we need to get a proper “cut-off” between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month. If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories. Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month’s amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.",
    "Definition of Trade Discount": "A trade discount is a routine reduction from the regular, established price of a product. The use of trade discounts allows a company to vary the final price based on each customer’s volume or status. Note that trade discounts are different from early-payment discounts. (Early-payment discounts of 1% or 2% are usually recorded by the seller in an account such as Sales Discounts and by the buyer using the periodic inventory method in an account such as Purchase Discounts.) Trade discounts are not recorded in a separate account by either the seller or the buyer.",
    "Example of Trade Discounts": "A distributor of merchandise may have a single catalog which displays a single price for each product. However, the distributor allows a trade discount from the catalog price based on each customer’s volume. For example, one product may have a catalog price of $100. A casual buyer will be charged $100. However, a reseller will be given a trade discount of 20% from the catalog price, and will be charged $80. Lastly, a registered high-volume wholesaler will be given a trade discount of 27% and will be charged $73.",
    "Recording Sales Having a Trade Discount": "The company selling the product (and the buyer of the product) will record the transaction at the amount after the trade discount is subtracted. For example, when goods with list prices totaling $1,000 are sold to a wholesaler that is entitled to a 27% trade discount, both the seller and the buyer will record the transaction at $730. There will not be a general ledger account entitled Trade Discount.",
    "Definition of Voucher": "A voucher is often a prenumbered form used in the accounts payable department to standardize and enhance a company’s internal control over payments to its vendors and service providers.",
    "Example of a Voucher": "You could think of the voucher used in accounts payable as a cover sheet to which necessary supporting documents and approvals are attached. Some of the supporting documents include:",
    "Periodic Inventory System": "In a periodic system the account Inventory:",
    "Perpetual Inventory System": "In a perpetual system the account Inventory:",
    "Definition of Company Controller": "A company’s controller is considered to be the chief accounting officer and the head of the accounting department.",
    "Role of the Controller": "As head of the accounting department, the controller will be responsible for the company’s:",
    "Definition of Accrued Interest": "Accrued interest is the amount of loan interest that has already occurred, but has not yet been paid by the borrower and not yet received by the lender. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount of accrued interest is to be recorded with accrual adjusting entries by the borrower and the lender before issuing their financial statements. The borrower’s adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense and credit Accrued Interest Payable (a current liability). The lender’s adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable (a current asset) and credit Interest Revenue (or Income).",
    "Example of Accrued Interest": "Let’s assume that on December 16, a company borrows $20,000 from its bank at an annual interest rate of 6%. The first interest payment is due 30 days later on January 15. Both the company and the bank have accounting years which end on December 31. The accrued interest as of December 31 is $50 ($20,000 X 6% = $1,200 per year = $100 per month = $50 for 1/2 month). The company’s adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense for $50, and will credit Accrued Interest Payable for $50. The bank’s adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable for $50, and will credit Interest Revenue for $50.",
    "Definition of Bank Balance": "The term bank balance is commonly used when reconciling the bank statement. It is also known as the balance per bank or balance per bank statement. Typically it is the ending balance on the bank statement for each month.",
    "Example of Bank Balance": "When a company receives its checking account statement from its bank showing June’s activity, the ending balance on June 30 is the bank balance. (Generally, this bank balance will not agree with the amount in the company’s records since some checks written by the company will not have cleared the bank by June 30. Similarly, some money received by the company on June 30 may not have been deposited in time for the amount to appear on the June bank statement.)",
    "Definition of Book Balance": "The term book balance, which is also used in the bank reconciliation is the amount shown in the company’s general ledger for the bank account. Book balance is also referred to as the balance per books.",
    "Example of Book Balance": "The balance on June 30 in the company’s general ledger account entitled Checking Account is the book balance that pertains to the bank account being reconciled. (For an individual, the book balance is likely to be the balance appearing in the person’s check register.) It is common for the book balance to not agree with the balance on the bank statement as of the same day. This is the case when there are bank fees or electronic transfers on the bank statement that have not yet been recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts. For example, the bank statement may reveal that a bank service charge was withdrawn from the account on the last day of the month.",
    "Definition of Unearned Income": "Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.",
    "Example #1 of Unearned Income": "A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company’s remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.",
    "Example #2 of Unearned Income": "A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer’s special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.",
    "Definition of Gift Certificates": "Gift certificates (and gift cards) are often sold by a retailer to a buyer for cash. The buyer can then redeem the gift certificate or give it to another person who can redeem the gift certificate for merchandise or services.",
    "Accounting for the Sale of Gift Certificates": "The sale of a gift certificate should be recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account such as Gift Certificates Outstanding. Note that revenue is not recorded at this point. Rather, the retailer is recording its obligation/liability to provide merchandise or services for the amount of the certificate sold.",
    "Accounting for the Redemption of a Gift Certificate": "When a gift certificate is presented to the retailer,  revenue will be recorded by the retailer for the amount of merchandise or services that were provided. This is done with a debit to the liability account Gift Certificates Outstanding and a credit to a revenue account. Our explanation pertains to financial accounting. To learn about the income tax treatment of this transaction, you should seek advice from a tax professional or go to www.irs.gov.",
    "Definition of Aging": "In accounting,  the term aging  is often associated with a company’s accounts receivable. Accounts receivable arise when a company provides goods or services and allows the customer to pay 10 or 30 days later. If some customers do not honor the terms of the sale, the company can experience a temporary or even permanent cash flow problem. In order for the company to minimize these potential problems, a company is wise to routinely review an aging of accounts receivable.  The aging of accounts receivable sorts the company’s accounts receivables by customer and then by time since the sales invoice was issued. Generally, the older the unpaid sales invoice, the greater the likelihood of not collecting the full amount. Since the aging of accounts receivable is a standard feature of accounting software, it is available with a click of the mouse. The aging is also useful for estimating the amount needed in the related account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.",
    "Example of an Aging Report": "The aging report lists each customer’s name and its unpaid sales invoices that make up the account receivable balance. Then the amounts of each unpaid sales invoice are placed in one of six columns that appear to the right. The headings for those columns are: Current, 1-30 days past due, 31-60 days past due, 61-90 days past due, 91-120 days past due, and 120+ days past due. The aging of accounts receivable gives the company’s management a valuable and easy-to-read report that highlights the customers with past due sales invoices.  An aging can also be prepared for the company’s accounts payable. The aging of accounts payable is based on the dates that the vendors’ invoices are to be paid.",
    "Definition of Carriage Inwards": "Carriage inwards refers to the transportation costs required to be paid by the purchaser when it receives merchandise it ordered with terms FOB shipping point. Carriage inwards is also known as freight-in or transportation-in. Carriage inwards is considered to be part of the cost of the items purchased. Hence, for inventory items carriage inwards will be part of the cost of the goods available, the cost of inventory, and the cost of goods sold.",
    "Example of Carriage Inwards": "Assume that a company uses the periodic inventory method and it purchases goods with terms FOB shipping point. As a result the company is responsible for paying the cost of the carriage inwards. The company will record the amount in the general ledger account Carriage Inwards (or Freight-in or Transportation-in). The carriage inwards costs are considered to be part of the cost of items purchased, since an asset’s cost is defined as all costs that are necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.",
    "Definition of Income Received in Advance": "Under the accrual method of accounting, when a company receives money from a customer prior to earning it, the company will have to make the following entry:",
    "Example of Income Received in Advance": "Assume that Jones Corporation received $10,000 from a customer on December 31 for work that will be done in the following month. On December 31, Jones Corporation will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Deferred Revenue for $10,000. Therefore, Jones Corporation’s December 31 balance sheet’s Cash will include the $10,000 and its current liabilities will report Deferred Revenue of $10,000. After Jones Corporation delivers the goods or services, it will debit Deferred Revenue for $10,000 and will credit Sales Revenues or Service Revenues for $10,000. ",
    "Definition of Insurance Expense": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, insurance expense is the cost of insurance that has been incurred, has expired, or has been used up during the current accounting period for the nonmanufacturing functions of a business. A manufacturer will report on its income statement the insurance expense incurred for its selling, general and administrative functions. However, the insurance costs associated with the manufacturing function are included in the cost of the current period’s output. Any prepaid insurance costs are to be reported as a current asset.",
    "Example of Insurance Expense": "Let’s assume that a retailer has insurance policies for its property, general liability, vehicles, and employees’ worker compensation, medical, dental, life, and disability. The company pays the premiums on the various insurance policies in advance. Any insurance premium costs that have not expired as of the balance sheet date should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance. The costs that have expired should be reported in income statement accounts such as Insurance Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, etc. Here’s a recap for the cost of insurance at the retailer:",
    "Definition of Loan Payment": "Generally a loan payment consists of:",
    "Definition of Customer Deposit": "A customer deposit could be money that a company received from a customer prior to the company earning it. (The company had not yet provided the customer with the associated goods or services.) In other words, the company received the asset Cash and has the obligation to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. Hence, the current liability account Customer Deposits is credited. When the company earns the deposit amount, Customer Deposits will be debited and Sales Revenues will be credited. A customer deposit could also refer to the money a bank received from a depositor. Since the bank has not earned this money, the amount is recorded by the bank with a debit to its asset account Cash and a credit to the bank’s liability account Customer Deposits.",
    "Example of Customer Deposit": "Let’s assume that Ace Manufacturing Inc. agrees to produce an expensive, custom-made machine for one of its customers. Ace requires that the customer pay $50,000 before Ace begins to design and construct the machine. The $50,000 payment is made in December 2023 and the machine must be finished by March 31, 2024. The $50,000 is a down payment toward the machine’s price of $400,000. In December 2023 Ace will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit Customer Deposits, a current liability account. When the machine is completed in 2024, Ace will debit Customer Deposits for $50,000 and will credit Sales Revenues for $50,000. Let’s break down the above customer deposit example step by step. December 2023\nAce Manufacturing Inc. receives a $50,000 down payment from the customer.  January – March 2024\nAce designs and constructs the custom-made machine. March 2024\nAce completes the custom-made machine by March 31, 2024, as agreed. ",
    "Definition of Sales Tax": "In the U.S., a sales tax is a state tax (and possibly an additional city and/or county tax) that is paid by the buyer at the time of purchase. The sales tax is based on certain products’ (or services’) selling prices and the sales tax rate. For instance, in some states unprepared grocery items are not subject to a sales tax. Items purchased for resale are not subject to the sales tax when purchased by the retailer, but will be subject to the sales tax when the items are sold to the end customer. In some cities, there could be a state sales tax of 6% plus a county tax of 1% and a tourist district sales tax of 3%. In another state there could be only a sales tax rate of 8%. The sales taxes collected by a merchant are not part of the merchant’s sales and are not part of the merchant’s expenses. Instead, the merchant is merely an agent of the state and will record the sales taxes collected in a current liability account such as Sales Taxes Payable. When the merchant remits the sales taxes to the state, the current liability account is reduced. If a company purchases a new delivery van, the sales taxes paid on the van are recorded as part of the cost of the van. The total cost of the van will then be charged to depreciation expense over the van’s useful life.",
    "Examples of Sales Tax": "If a company sells $100,000 of merchandise that is subject to a state sales tax of 7%, the company will collect $107,000. The journal entry to record this information is:",
    "Accounting for Labor to Install Asset": "The definition of an asset’s cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period). The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset’s useful life.",
    "Definition of Accrued Payroll": "Accrued payroll includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other payroll related expenses that have been earned by a company’s employees, but have not yet been paid or recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts.",
    "Example of Accrued Payroll": "Let’s assume that a retailer’s hourly-paid employees are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. Let’s also assume that as of December 31, the hours worked from December 27 through December 31 will be part of the payroll that will be processed in early January and paid to the employees on Friday, January 8. The amount of the wages for the five days of December 27 through December 31 are calculated to be $5,000. In addition, the retailer incurred payroll taxes and fringe benefits amounting to $1,000. Therefore, the total amount of accrued payroll is $6,000. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer must report the $6,000 of accrued payroll as:",
    "Reasons for Preparing a Bank Reconciliation": "There are several reasons for a company to prepare a bank reconciliation:",
    "Examples of Closing Entries": "Two examples of closing entries are:",
    "Definition of an Account Payable": "An account payable is an amount owed to a supplier or vendor for goods or services that were provided in advance of payment. However, some people use the term only if the amount is already recorded in the general ledger account Accounts Payable. (Until it is, they refer to the amount as one of the company’s accrued liabilities.) For others, it is an account payable even if it is not yet recorded in Accounts Payable.",
    "Example of an Account Payable": "Assume that a corporation received repair services from Joe’s Plumbing LLC on August 29. On August 31 the corporation receives an invoice from Joe’s for $900. The invoice states that the $900 is due within 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the corporation enters Joe’s invoice into its accounting records with a credit to Accounts Payable and debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense. Until the invoice from Joe’s Plumbing Service is paid, Joe’s invoice serves as a supporting document for the balance in the corporation’s Accounts Payable. (The invoice is also a supporting document for the balance in Joe’s Accounts Receivable.)",
    "Definition of Loss": "A loss could have several meanings. The following examples illustrate how the term is used.",
    "Examples of Losses": "Some examples of losses include:",
    "Difference between Unadjusted Trial Balance and Adjusted Trial Balance": "The differences between an unadjusted trial balance and an adjusted trial balance are the amounts in the adjusting entries.",
    "Example of Closing Entries": "The closing entries will transfer all of the year-end balances from the revenue accounts and the expense accounts to a corporation’s retained earnings account or a sole proprietorship’s owner’s equity account. With today’s accounting software, the closing entries are effortless.",
    "2024 FICA Tax Rate for Self-Employed": "The self-employed person’s FICA tax rate for 2024 (January 1 through December 31, 2024) is 15.3% on the first $168,600 of net income plus 2.9% on the net income in excess of $168,600. In other words, the self-employed person’s FICA tax rate for 2024 includes all of the following:",
    "2025 FICA Tax Rate for Self-Employed": "The self-employed person’s FICA tax rate for 2025 (January 1 through December 31, 2025) is 15.3% on the first $176,100 of net income plus 2.9% on the net income in excess of $176,100. In other words, the self-employed person’s FICA tax rate for 2025 includes all of the following:",
    "Definition of Bookkeeper": "A bookkeeper is usually employed by a small to mid-size company (or other organization) to process and record the large volume of transactions involving sales, purchases, payroll, collection of accounts receivable, payment of bills, and more. After the recording of the transactions, an accountant or the business owner will review the bookkeeper’s work and make the required adjusting entries before the company’s financial statements are distributed. (Larger companies are likely to have accounts payable clerks, payroll clerks, cost accounting clerks, etc. instead of bookkeepers.) Related: What is the difference between a bookkeeper and an accountant?",
    "Things that Bookkeepers Do": "At small companies bookkeepers may be involved in the following activities:",
    "Example of Interest Payable": "Let’s assume that on December 1 a company borrowed $100,000 at an annual interest rate of 12%. The company agrees to repay the principal amount of $100,000 plus 9 months of interest when the note comes due on August 31. On December 31, the amount of interest payable is $1,000 ($100,000 X 12% X 1/12) and the company’s balance sheet should report the following current liabilities:",
    "Definition of an Old Outstanding Check": "We will assume that an outstanding check has appeared on the outstanding check list that is part of the company’s bank reconciliation for at least four months. In other words, the company issued the check more than four months earlier and the check has not yet cleared the company’s bank account.",
    "Example of Writing Off an Old Outstanding Check": "On January 22, a company issued a check for $124 for a business expense. As of June 30, the check has not cleared the company’s bank account. Since the company owed the payee $124, the company should contact the the payee to cash the check. (If the check is not cashed within a certain number of years, the company will have to remit the amount of the uncashed check to its state government as unclaimed property.) If the payee says the check was never received, the company should issue a replacement check for $124 and send it to the payee. The replacement check for $124 should be credited to the company’s general ledger Cash account and also debited to the same Cash account since the original check is being eliminated.  The best practice is to communicate with the payees of your outstanding checks before the checks have been outstanding for a second month. This may eliminate the accounting entries and the need to report and remit the outstanding check amounts to your state government years later.",
    "What a Bookkeeper Should Know": "Bookkeepers are not expected to have a four-year or five-year college degree in accounting. However, the bookkeeper must be able to work quickly and accurately. Today’s bookkeeper must be comfortable with accounting software such as QuickBooks and electronic worksheets. Being proficient with accounting software allows a bookkeeper to stand out from the others.",
    "Salary Range for a Bookkeeper": "The annual salary for a bookkeeper could range from $18,000 to more than $40,000. Some reasons for the wide salary range include the size and location of the company, the bookkeeper’s responsibilities, the bookkeeper’s experience with accounting and other software, the ability to get things done without supervision, etc. (In terms of an hourly wage, the bookkeeper’s pay could range from $9 to $20 per hour.)",

    "Definition of a Contingent Liability": "A contingent liability is a potential liability (and a potential loss or potential expense). For a contingent liability to become an actual liability a future event must occur.",
    "Examples of Contingent Liabilities": "Assume someone files a lawsuit against Jay Corp. Jay Corp now has a contingent liability. The lawsuit will become an actual liability only if Jay Corp is unsuccessful in defending itself. (Many lawsuits are nuisance suits that will not be victorious in court.) Another contingent liability is the warranty that automakers provide on new cars. Since it is probable (not merely possible) that some vehicles will require work during the warranty period and the automakers can estimate that amount, the estimated amount of the warranty cost will be reported as a liability on the automakers’ balance sheets at the time that the cars are sold. The other part of the journal entry is to debit Warranty Expense and report it on the income statement.",
    "Definition of an Estimated Liability": "An estimated liability is a liability that is absolutely owed because the services or goods have been received. However, the vendors’ invoices have not yet been received and the exact amount is not yet known. The company is required to estimate the amount since the estimated amount is far better than implying that no liability is owed and that no expense was incurred. Many of the accrual adjusting entries require estimated amounts.",
    "Examples of Estimated Liabilities": "Liabilities that are not contingent liabilities but are estimated liabilities include the following:",
    "Definition of FICA": "FICA is the acronym for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. FICA consists of the U.S. Social Security payroll tax and the Medicare payroll tax. The FICA payroll tax is withheld from employees and also matched by the employer. In effect, the employer is responsible for remitting two times the amount withheld from its employees. For the calendar year 2024, the FICA withholding consists of:",
    "Definition of FICA Matching": "In addition, the employer is required to match the following amounts that were withheld from the employees’ paychecks:",
    "Example of FICA Matching": "If an employer has only one employee earning $30,000 per year, the employer must withhold from the employee’s paychecks a total of $2,295 in FICA taxes. (Social Security tax = $30,000 X 6.2% = $1,860. Regular Medicare tax = $30,000 X 1.45% = $435.) The employer must also match the $2,295 and remit the total of $4,590 to the U.S. government within a specified period after the dates of the paychecks.",
    "FICA Matching is an Additional Part of an Employee’s Compensation": "The employer’s matching of the FICA taxes (the matching amounts for the Social Security tax and the regular Medicare tax) is recorded by the employer as a payroll tax expense or fringe benefit expense if the employees do not work in a manufacturing department. If the employee works in a manufacturing department, the amount of the FICA matching is recorded as part of the company’s manufacturing costs. You can find the rules for FICA taxes in the Internal Revenue Service Publication 15 (Circular E) Employer’s Tax Guide at the website www.irs.gov.",
    "Definition of Vendor": "In the context of accounts payable, a vendor is a person or business that supplies goods or services to the company. Another term for vendor is supplier. The term vendor can also be used to mean any seller of goods.",
    "Examples of Vendor": "Assume that a company prepares and submits purchase orders to its suppliers whenever the company orders goods. Th suppliers are referred to as the company’s vendors. When the company receives the goods it ordered, it will also receive an invoice. The company may refer to the invoice as the vendor invoice. A wider use of the term vendor would be the peanut vendor at a baseball game or the vending machine in the break room.",
    "Definition of Salvage Value": "In accounting, salvage value is the amount that is expected to be received at the end of a plant asset‘s useful life. Salvage value is sometimes referred to as disposal value, residual value, terminal value, or scrap value. When calculating the depreciation expense of an asset, the expected amount of the salvage value is not included.",
    "Example of Salvage Value": "Assume that a plant asset has a cost of $325,000 and is expected to have a salvage value of $25,000 at the end of its 5-year useful life. The depreciable cost of $300,000 ($325,000 – $25,000) is divided by the 5 years of useful life to arrive at the straight-line depreciation expense of $60,000 for a full year or $5,000 per month ($300,000/60 months).  Accountants and income tax regulations often assume that plant assets will have no salvage value. This will result in an asset’s entire cost being depreciated during the years that the asset is used in the business. Any amount received that is in excess of the asset’s book value will be reported as a gain at the time it is sold.",
    "Definition of Payroll Accrual": "The payroll accrual is the amounts a company owes for work done by employees, but the amounts have not yet been recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts. The related expenses and the liabilities for the employees’ work must be recorded for the company’s financial statements to reflect the accrual basis of accounting.",
    "Example of Calculating the Payroll Accrual": "Assume that a company prepares monthly financial statements as of the last day of every month. Its hourly-paid employees are paid on Fridays for the hours worked in the previous workweek of Sunday through Saturday. Now assume that the last day of the month is Monday, June 30. This means that the hourly-paid employees were last paid on Friday, June 27 for the hours they worked through Saturday, June 21. Therefore, as of June 30 the company owes its hourly-paid employees for the amounts they earned between June 22 and June 30. Prior to issuing its June 30 financial statements, the company must record an accrual adjusting entry dated June 30 to record the amounts owed to its hourly-paid employees for working from June 22 through June 30. (The amount for the workweek of June 22-28 might be calculated by the time the adjusting entry is prepared in early July and only the amounts for June 29 and 30 will need to be estimated.) The important point with the accrual method/basis of accounting is:",
    "Definition of Purchases": "In the context of companies that sell merchandise, the term purchases refers to the purchases of goods that are intended to be sold to customers. The cost of the goods that are sold are expensed on the income statement. (The cost of goods sold is likely the largest operating expense and it is being matched to the related sales revenue to arrive at a company’s gross profit.) The cost of the items that are not yet sold are reported on the balance sheet as inventory.",
    "Example of Purchases Reported in the Income Statement": "Assume that an online seller begins operations on January 2 by purchasing $5,000 of goods consisting of 1,000 items which cost $5 each. The goods are going to be sold for $12 each. There are two common ways to account for the inventory and the cost of goods sold:",
    "Definition of Return Deposit Item": "A return deposit item is usually a customer’s check that was part of a company’s bank deposit. When the company’s bank sends the customer’s check through to the bank on which it was drawn, the check was returned unpaid. Perhaps, the customer’s checking account balance was insufficient, perhaps a stop payment order prevented the check from being paid, or perhaps there was another reason. When the unpaid check arrives back at the company’s bank, the check amount plus a bank fee will be deducted from the company’s bank account balance. The company will receive the unpaid check and must remove the amount of the check and the bank fee from its general ledger accounts. This is achieved by crediting Cash, and debiting Accounts Receivable.",
    "Example of Return Deposit Item": "On May 23, ABC Company received a $2,000 check from a customer as payment of the amount owed. ABC debited Cash and credited Accounts Receivable for $2,000 and deposited the check in its checking account at First Bank. On May 26, ABC learned the customer’s check was returned because of insufficient funds and First Bank reduced the balance in ABC’s checking account by $2,025 (includes a bank fee of $25). On May 26, ABC records the returned check in its general ledger accounts by debiting Accounts Receivable for $2,025 and crediting Cash for $2,025. Given these facts, no adjustment is required on ABC’s May 31 bank reconciliation, since both the bank and the company’s general ledger are in agreement. On the other hand, if ABC had not recorded the returned check in its general ledger accounts as of May 31, ABC’s May 31 bank reconciliation will require an adjustment to the balance per books for $2,025 to agree with the bank’s records.  ",
    "Definition of Accrued Interest on Notes Receivable": "Accrued interest on notes receivable is the amount of interest the lender has earned, but the lender has not yet received it.",
    "Example of Reporting Accrued Interest on Notes Receivable": "Assume that on December 1, a company has lent one of its suppliers $30,000 with interest at 12% per year. Interest is to be paid quarterly (with the first interest payment to be made on March 1). On December 31, the company has earned accrued interest of $300 ($30,000 X 12% X 1/12). The company will record a December 31 accrual adjusting entry which debits Interest Receivable for $300 and credits Interest Income for $300. The Interest Receivable account balance will be reported on the company’s balance sheet as a current asset such as Accrued Interest Receivable or Interest Receivable. The accrued interest receivable is a current asset since the $300 is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date.",
    "Definition of Post-closing Trial Balance": "A post-closing trial balance is a trial balance which is prepared after all of the temporary accounts in the general ledger have been closed.  Trial balances are not financial statements. Instead, they are accounting department documents that are not distributed. Since most trial balances do not list accounts with zero balances, the post-closing trial balance will include only general ledger balance sheet accounts having balances other than $0.00. The debit and credit amount columns will be summed and the totals should be identical. Accounting software will generate a post-closing trial balance (or any other trial balance) with a click of the mouse.",
    "Example of Post-closing Trial Balance": "The post-closing trial balance will have a heading that includes the company name, the title Trial Balance, and the date of the account balances. After the heading you will likely see the following column headings: account number, account title, debit balance amount, and credit balance amount. Next will be a listing of all of the general ledger balance sheet accounts (except those with $0.00 balances) along with each account’s balance appearing in the appropriate debit or credit column. At the bottom of the debit balance and credit balance columns will be a total for each. When accounting software is used, the totals should always be identical.",
    "Example of Depreciation Charges": "Assume that a corporation purchased equipment to be used in its business at a cost of $500,000. It is expected that the equipment will have no salvage value at the end of an estimated useful life of 10 years. For its financial statements the corporation will usually charge the same amount each year. In our example, this means $50,000 ($500,000/10 yrs) of annual depreciation expense for 10 years. (U.S. income tax rules allow accelerating the yearly depreciation amounts, but the total amount of depreciation cannot exceed the asset’s cost.)",
    "Definition of Restrictive Endorsement": "A restrictive endorsement or restricted endorsement places a limitation on the use of a check or other negotiable financial instrument.  Using a restrictive endorsement is one of many actions that a company can take in order to improve the internal control of its assets.",
    "Examples of Restrictive Endorsements": "The most common restrictive endorsement is the phrase For Deposit Only  written along with the payee’s signature on the back of a check. A similar restrictive endorsement might be Pay to the Order of Sample Bank for deposit to account #xxxx followed by the payee’s signature. Many companies endorse checks by using a rubber stamp containing this restriction. Another example of a restrictive endorsement is Pay to the order of John Doe, which allows only John Doe to cash the check.",
    "Definition of Sale of Land": "Assume that a retailer sells land that it had been holding for a future store. The retailer must remove the cost of the land from its general ledger asset account Land, record the cash received, and record the gain or loss on the sale of the land. ",
    "Example of Sale of Land": "Assume that the retailer had purchased the parcel of land 15 years earlier for $200,000 in order to add another retail store. The retailer now decides to sell the parcel for $500,000.  Since there was no depreciation on the land, the retailer records the sale as follows:",
    "Social Security Payroll Tax": "The Social Security payroll tax is 6.2% and is based on each employee’s earnings (wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, etc.) up to a specified annual ceiling, limit, or maximum. In the calendar year 2024, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee’s earnings up to the maximum of $168,600. The amount withheld from employees is then matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2024 is equal to 12.4% of each employee’s annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $168,600. In the calendar year 2025, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee’s earnings up to the maximum of $176,100. The Social Security tax withheld from employees is then matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2025 is equal to 12.4% of each employee’s annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $176,100. The Social Security tax pertains to retirement and disability benefits.",
    "Medicare Payroll Tax": "The Medicare payroll tax is 1.45% and is based on each employee’s earnings without limit. The Medicare tax withheld from employees is then matched by the employer. This makes the total Medicare tax equal to 2.9% on every dollar of employees’ earnings. (There is also an Additional Medicare Tax for high income employees and high income self-employed individuals. However, the Additional Medicare Tax is not matched by the employer.) The Medicare tax pertains to health care for people 65 of age and older.",
    "FICA Payroll Tax": "The combination of Social Security payroll taxes and Medicare payroll taxes is referred to as FICA. We often cite the FICA tax rate as 7.65% (6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare) of each employee’s first $168,600 of annual earnings in 2024 and the first $176,100 of annual earnings in 2025. Each employee’s earnings in excess of the annual Social Security ceiling amount are taxed only for Medicare (1.45% for the employee and 1.45% for the employer). As mentioned above, there is also an Additional Medicare Tax that is withheld from high income employees’ pay, but it is not matched by the employer. Self-employed persons are responsible for both the employee and employer portions of FICA.",
    "Definition of Accrual Adjusting Entries": "Accrual adjusting entries or simply accruals are one of three types of adjusting entries which are prepared at the end of an accounting period so that a company’s financial statements will comply with the accrual method of accounting. Expressed another way, accrual adjusting entries are the means for including transactions that occurred during the current accounting period but have not yet been recorded in a company’s general ledger accounts. Without accrual adjusting entries those transactions will likely be reported in a later accounting period. This means that the financial statements for two accounting periods will be reporting incorrect amounts.",
    "Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Expenses": "To illustrate, let’s assume that New Corp begins its business on December 1 and uses Sales Rep Company for calling on customers. For this service, New Corp agrees to pay commissions of 5% of sales with payment made 10 days after the month ends. Assuming that December’s sales are $100,000 New Corp will be incurring commissions expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000. However, the payment will actually occur on January 10. Without an accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 New Corp’s financial statements will have the following problems:",
    "Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Revenues": "Over at Sales Rep Company, for its financial statements to comply with the accrual method of accounting it needs to record the following accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 (assuming its billing will take place in early January): debit the asset account Commissions Receivable for $5,000; credit Commissions Revenues for $5,000. Without this accrual entry as of December 31, Sales Rep Company’s December financial statements will have the following problems:",
    "Definition of Uncleared Cheque": "An uncleared cheque is a cheque (check) that has been written and recorded in the payer’s records, but has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. In the U.S. accounting textbooks, an uncleared cheque is referred to as an outstanding check. In the bank reconciliation process an uncleared cheque (or outstanding check) is deducted from the balance shown on the bank statement to arrive at the correct or adjusted balance per bank.",
    "Example of Uncleared Cheque": "On December 28, a company records and mails a check for $8,120 to one of its suppliers in another region of the country. As of December 31, the check has not yet cleared the company’s checking account. Therefore, this $8,120 check is an uncleared cheque or an outstanding check. ",
    "Definition of Reversal of Accrued Expense": "An accrued expense typically requires an accrual adjusting entry recorded at the end of an accounting year (or any other accounting period). The accrual adjusting entry is needed to get the expense reported on the income statement for the period when the expense was incurred and as a current liability on the end-of-the-year balance sheet. After the financial statements are distributed the adjusting entry can be permanently removed. On the first day in the next accounting period, a reversing entry will be recorded to permanently remove the accrued amounts because the actual  invoice for the accrued expense will be received and processed. The reversing entry assures that the expense will be reported once on the company’s financial statements.",
    "Example of Reversal of Accrued Expense": "Assume that a company incurred $10,000 of interest expense that has not yet been recorded as of December 31 (the final day of the accounting year). Therefore, a December 31 accrual adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense with this additional $10,000 and will credit Accrued Interest Payable. This will get the proper amounts on the company’s income statement and balance sheet. The account Interest Expense will begin January with a zero balance, since expenses are temporary accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting year. On January 2, a reversing entry is recorded which removes the $10,000 liability and causes a $10,000 credit balance in Interest Expense. The negative amount in Interest Expense will disappear when the actual interest expense is recorded in January.",
    "Definition of Bookkeeping Equation": "The bookkeeping equation (or accounting equation) is similar to the structure of the balance sheet:",
    "Example of Bookkeeping Equation": "Assume that Sara Jones starts a sole proprietorship, SJCO, by depositing $900 in a new business checking account. The bookkeeping equation will show the following: Assets of $900 = Owner’s Equity of $900. In words, the equation indicates that SJCO has resources of $900 and that the owner has the only claim to its resources. The equation also indicates that the resources of $900 were provided by the owner. Next, assume that SJCO incurs advertising expense of $250, but the bill will be paid 10 days later. Since owner’s equity is reduced by expenses (and is increased by revenues), the bookkeeping equation will show the following: Assets of $900 = Liabilities of $250 + Owner’s Equity of $650. After the advertising bill is paid, the bookkeeping equation will show these amounts: Assets of $650 = Owner’s Equity of $650.        To learn more about the bookkeeping or accounting equation, see our Explanation, Quiz, and more.",
    "Employer Must Match the Employees’ FICA Withholdings": "In addition to the FICA amounts withheld from employees’, the employer must match the FICA taxes withheld from employees. In other words, the employer will have an additional expense equal to the total of the FICA taxes withheld from its employees (except that the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax). The employer must remit the FICA withholdings plus its matching amount to the federal government by specified dates. A self-employed person pays both the employee and employer portions of the FICA tax.",
    "Additional Information on FICA": "The annual earnings wage limits, FICA rates, and information on the Additional Medicare Tax for higher income ($200,000+) taxpayers can be found on IRS.gov.",
    "Definition of Income Statements of Sole Proprietorship and Regular Corporation": "The income statement of a sole proprietorship and a regular corporation reports their revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and net income. However, there are two noteworthy differences:",
    "Examples of Income Statements of Sole Proprietorship and Regular Corporation": "Assume that both a sole proprietorship and a regular corporation had revenues and gains of $350,000 and expenses and losses of $200,000 (not counting any compensation for the owner). In addition, the stockholder working in the corporation earns a salary of $80,000. The owner of the sole proprietor works as hard, but instead of a salary, draws $80,000 for personal use. The regular corporation pays a $10,000 cash dividend and its income tax rate is 15%. The income statement of the sole proprietorship will report net income of $160,000 ($360,000 – $200,000). The corporation’s income statement will report net before income tax of $80,000 ($360,000 – $280,000) and net income after tax of $68,000 ($80,000 – $12,000). As a result of these two differences, the net income (which is the bottom line of the income statements) will be different. In the case of the sole proprietorship, the net income is the total amount that the owner has earned before income taxes for 1) the capital invested in the business and 2) the owner’s compensation for working in the business. In the case of a regular corporation owned by one person, the owner has earned the salary (which was included in salary expense on the income statement) and has also earned the reported amount of net income or net loss. Neither the draws made by the sole proprietor nor the dividends distributed by a regular corporation are reported on the income statement.",
    "Definition of Adjusting Prepaid Expenses": "The balance in the current asset account Prepaid Expenses should be adjusted prior to a company issuing its financial statements.  If the company issues financial statements at the end of each calendar month, the balance in the account Prepaid Expenses must be adjusted so that the balance sheet reports the amount that is actually prepaid (not yet expired) at the end of the month. If the company issues only quarterly financial statements, the account balance in Prepaid Expenses must report the actual amount that is actually prepaid (not yet expired) at the end of the quarter.",
    "Example of Adjusting Prepaid Expenses": "Assume that a company’s only prepaid expense is the prepaid premiums on its liability insurance policy. Also assume that on December 1, the company paid $6,000 for the  insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31. The company recorded the December 1 payment with a debit of $6,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $6,000 to Cash. On December 31, the account Prepaid Expenses must be adjusted to report a balance of $5,000 since the amount prepaid is decreasing by $1,000 a month. Therefore, an adjusting entry must be recorded as of December 31 to credit Prepaid Expenses for $1,000 and to debit Insurance Expense for $1,000. The same adjusting entry must be recorded as of the last day of January, February, March, April, and May. ",
    "Definition of Loan Interest": "Loan interest is the expense a borrower incurs for using a lender’s money. Loan interest is also the income earned by a lender for allowing the borrower to use the lender’s money. ",
    "Definition of Bank Loan Repayment": "A bank loan repayment is likely referring to the loan principal balance (or part of the principal balance) that the borrower is paying the lender (bank). When the principal payment is made, the borrower’s liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable is decreased and the bank’s asset Notes Receivable or Loans Receivable is decreased.",
    "Definition of Nonmanufacturing Overhead Costs": "Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the business expenses that are outside of a company’s manufacturing operations. In other words, these costs are not part of a manufacturer’s product cost or its production costs (which are direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead). Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the company’s selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plus the company’s interest expense. Since nonmanufacturing overhead costs are outside of the manufacturing function, these nonmanufacturing costs are immediately expensed in the accounting period in which they are incurred. That is why accountants refer to nonmanufacturing costs as period costs or period expenses. ",
    "Examples of Nonmanufacturing Overhead Costs": "Examples of the nonmanufacturing overhead costs include the salaries and other expenses for the following business activities: selling, distribution, marketing, finance, accounting, IT, human resources, legal, and so on. (We have additional examples within our AccountingCoach.com topic Nonmanufacturing Overhead.) While the nonmanufacturing overhead costs are not allocated to the products, the company must have its selling prices and sales revenues sufficiently large to cover both the product costs and the period expenses to have a positive amount of net income.",
    "Definition of Accelerated Depreciation": "Accelerated depreciation means the cost of an asset used in a business will be charged to Depreciation Expense at a faster rate than straight-line depreciation. However, the total amount of depreciation expense over the life of the asset cannot exceed the asset’s cost regardless of the depreciation method. In other words, the difference between accelerated depreciation and straight-line depreciation is a “timing difference.” In the U.S., a business is allowed to use straight-line depreciation on its financial statements and at the same time use accelerated depreciation on its income tax returns.  Using accelerated depreciation on its U.S. income tax returns will mean greater depreciation expense and smaller taxable income in the earlier years of an asset’s life. However, it will be followed by smaller depreciation expense and greater taxable income in the later years of the asset’s life. Therefore, a corporation with consistent taxable income will be able to defer some income taxes until the later years of the asset’s life. This is especially attractive because of the time value of money.",
    "Examples of Accelerated Depreciation Methods": "Three examples of accelerated depreciation methods include the following:",
    "Use of Accelerated Depreciation for Income Tax Reporting": "The U.S. income tax regulations allow a business to use accelerated depreciation on its income tax return while using straight-line depreciation on its financial statements. For profitable corporations, this likely results in deferred income tax payments.",
    "Definition of Float": "In accounting and bookkeeping, float is the time between the writing of a check and the time that the check clears the bank account on which it is drawn.",
    "Examples of Float": "Payer Corporation writes a check for $5,000 and mails it to a supplier on Wednesday. However, the check will not clear Payer Corporation’s checking account until Monday. Hence, Payer Corporation will have $5,000 of float between Wednesday and Monday. Mary plays the float when she mails her rent check on Thursday even though she does not have a sufficient balance in her personal checking account. She is counting on her paycheck being electronically deposited on Monday morning prior to her rent check clearing her checking account. Float is associated with the outstanding checks shown on the bank reconciliation.",
    "Definition of Mortgage Loan": "A mortgage loan is a loan associated with the purchase of real estate, such as a home or buildings used in a business. As part of the loan process, the lender files a mortgage with the county where the property is located. The mortgage provides a lien on the property that protects the lender if the borrower fails to pay the amounts owed.",
    "Example of a Mortgage Loan": "Typically, mortgage loans are long-term loans requiring monthly payments of interest and principal. For example, assume that a company wants to buy a vacant warehouse for $500,000. The company’s banker agrees to lend the company $350,000 in the form of a 5-year mortgage loan with monthly payments of interest and principal. The mortgage filed with the county where the warehouse is located shows that the bank has the first claim on the property for any principal and interest owed by the borrower. On any given date, the borrower is liable for the unpaid principal balance plus any accrued interest expense up to that point. The borrower’s balance sheets will report:",
    "Employer’s Social Security Payroll Tax for 2024": "The employer’s Social Security payroll tax rate for 2024 (January 1 through December 31, 2024) is the same as the employee’s Social Security payroll tax: 6.2% of each employee’s first $168,600 of wages, salaries, etc. If an employee’s 2024 wages, salaries, etc. exceed $168,600, the amount in excess of $168,600 is not subject to the Social Security tax. Hence, the maximum amount of the employer’s Social Security tax for each employee in 2024 is $10,453.20 (6.2% X $168,600).",
    "Employer’s Social Security Payroll Tax for 2025": "The employer’s Social Security payroll tax rate for 2025 (January 1 through December 31, 2025) is 6.2% of each employee’s first $176,100 of wages, salaries, etc. (This amount is identical to the employee’s Social Security tax that is withheld from the employee’s wages, salaries, etc.) If an employee’s 2025 wages, salaries, etc. are greater than $176,100, the amount in excess of $176,100 is not subject to the Social Security tax. Hence, the maximum amount of the employer’s Social Security tax for each employee in 2025 is $10,918.20 (6.2% X $176,100). In effect, the employer is matching the Social Security payroll tax withheld from each employee’s wages, salaries, etc. The employer is responsible for remitting the amounts withheld from employees’ wages and the employer’s matching amount to the U.S. government by specified dates.",
    "Social Security Payroll Tax is One Part of the FICA Payroll Tax": "The combination of the Social Security payroll tax and the Medicare payroll tax is referred to as the FICA tax. However, there is no annual limit or cap on the earnings when computing the Medicare tax for the employee, the self-employed person, or the employer.",
    "Definition of Sales Taxes": "Sales taxes are likely state and local taxes collected by the sellers of specified goods and the providers of specified services. The sales taxes are paid by the ultimate consumer (as opposed to a company that will resell the goods) and is typically a percentage of the selling prices. The seller must file a sales tax report and remit the sales taxes it had collected.  Basically, the company making the sale and collecting the sales taxes is an agent for the state and local government. Therefore, the sales taxes collected are not part of the seller’s sales or revenues. This means the amount of sales taxes that were collected by the retailer will not be reported on its income statement. Instead, the sales taxes collected are reported on the balance sheet as a current liability until they are remitted to the government.",
    "Explanation of Sales Taxes": "Assume that all of a retailer’s products are subject to a state sales tax of 6%. If the retailer sells goods having selling prices of $500, it will collect $530 [$500 + (6% of $500)]. This will be recorded as follows:",
    "Definition of Segregation of Duties": "The segregation of duties involves dividing a task so that more than one person is involve in the company’s transactions. By segregating duties, it will require at least two people to agree to steal or embezzle a company’s resources.  The segregation of duties (or separation of duties) is part of a company’s internal controls for safeguarding its assets. ",
    "Example of Segregation of Duties": "An example of the segregation of duties is a company’s policy to have its checking account bank statement reconciled by someone other than a person writing checks and someone other than a person recording amounts in the company’s general ledger. Another example of the segregation of duties is that the person handling cash is not the person recording the cash amounts in the company’s ledgers.",
    "Definition of Accounting Entry When an Order is Received": "At the time when a company receives a customer’s order (without receiving payment), no accounting entry is made into the company’s general ledger accounts. (However, there could be an entry into the company’s computer system for scheduling the work or shipment, etc.)",
    "Reasons for No Accounting Entry When an Order is Received": "The following is the rationale for no entry into the company’s general ledger (and no effect on the company’s financial statements) at the time that an order is received:",
    "Social Security Payroll Tax for 2024": "The employee’s Social Security payroll tax rate for 2024 (January 1 through December 31, 2024) is 6.2% of the first $168,600 of wages, salaries, etc. An employee’s 2024 earnings in excess of $168,600 are not subject to the Social Security tax.",
    "Social Security Payroll Tax for 2025": "The employee’s Social Security payroll tax rate for 2025 (January 1 through December 31, 2025) is 6.2% of the first $176,100 of wages, salaries, etc. An employee’s 2025 earnings in excess of $176,100 are not subject to the Social Security tax.",
    "An Employer Must Match its Employees’ FICA Taxes": "In addition to the employees’ Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, the employer must match the amounts that were withheld from the employees’ paychecks (except that the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax).",
    "Definition of Accounts Written Off": "Accounts written off is likely referring to accounts receivable that a company deemed to be uncollectible and were removed from the general ledger account  Accounts Receivable.",
    "Example of Accounts Written Off": "Assume that one of a company’s customers who were given 30 days in which to pay has filed for bankruptcy and the customer’s assets are close to $0. Therefore, there will be no amount left to pay any of the $4,000 it owes to the company. The company will write off the uncollectible account by crediting Accounts Receivable for $4,000. The account the company will debit for $4,000 depends on whether the company has the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. If the company has the Allowance account, the company will debit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $4,000. If the company does not have an Allowance account, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense for $4,000.",
    "Definition of Not Sufficient Funds": "Not sufficient funds or NSF or insufficient funds is a term to describe a check that has been returned by the bank because the balance in the checking account on which the check was drawn was less than the amount of the check. The check being returned as not sufficient funds is also referred to as a returned check, a bank return item, a check that bounced, or a rubber check since it was bounced back to the payee by the bank on which the check was drawn. Checks returned as not sufficient funds usually result in bank charges for both the payee and for the person writing the check. A check returned as not sufficient funds could be an indication that the financial condition of the maker of the check may be suspect.",
    "Example of Not Sufficient Funds": "Assume a company wrote a check for $5,000 but the balance in its general ledger account Cash was $4,500. It planned on making a $1,000 deposit before the check cleared its bank account. Unfortunately, the $5,000 check was presented to the bank prior to the planned deposit. If the bank account balance was less than $5,000, the bank likely returned the $5,000 check to the payee’s bank with the notation: Returned due to not sufficient funds.",
    "Definition of Sale on Credit": "A sale on credit is revenue earned by a company when it sells goods and allows the buyer to pay at a later date. This is also referred to as a sale on account. Normally, this means that the company selling the goods is transferring ownership of its goods to the buyer and in return has a current asset known as accounts receivable. One consequence is the seller becomes one of the buyer’s unsecured creditors. This means that the seller has the risk of bad debts expense if the buyer does not pay the full amount owed to the seller.",
    "Example of a Sale on Credit": "Assume that a company is in an industry where it is necessary to give customers invoice payment terms of net 30 days. If the company sells $10,000 of goods to a customer with those terms, the company will debit Accounts Receivable for $10,0000 and will credit Sales for $10,000. When the company receives the $10,000 from the customer, the company will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Accounts Receivable for $10,000.  ",
    "Definition of Blank Check": "A blank check often refers to a check that has been signed by an authorized check signer without completing the other information (date, payee, amount).  A blank check could also refer to the completely blank checks that are received from a check printing company. These blank checks have not been signed. These checks are sometimes referred to as check stock and should be stored in a secure place until they are inserted into the company’s printer for paying suppliers, etc. Lastly, “blank check” sometimes indicates that a large, uncertain amount will be disbursed for a specific purpose. For instance, a wealthy grandparent may tell a grandchild that the full cost of getting a college education will be fully paid by the grandparent.",
    "Example of Blank Check": "For an example of a pre-signed blank check, assume that a small company has a checking account and the only authorized check signer is the owner. The owner is going to take a short vacation and will have the office manager be in charge. In case a payment must be made when the owner is on vacation, the owner gives the office manager three of the company’s checks bearing only the owner’s signature. Basically, the owner is trusting that the office manager will complete these checks only for a legitimate business transaction. This is obviously a poor practice since the office manager could violate the owner’s trust and issue the checks for any amount and to any person. Even if the office manager is a dependable, honest employee, the signed blank checks might be discovered by another person who then completes the check with any name and amount.",
    "Definition of Deferred Expenses": "Under the accrual basis  of accounting, an expense is a cost that is used up, has expired, or is directly related to revenues reported on a company’s income statement. The objective of the income statement is to report how profitable a company was during a time interval (period of time), such as a year, quarter, month, 52 weeks, etc. Costs that occurred but are not yet expensed on the income statement are typically referred to as deferred costs, deferred expenses, or prepaid expenses and are reported on the company’s balance sheet as current assets until they become an expense.",
    "Examples of Deferred Expenses": "Assume that a company pays $3,000 on December 30 to rent a warehouse for the upcoming three-month period of January 1 through March 31. Since none of the $3,000 expired or was used up in December, the entire $3,000 is deferred to the balance sheet account Prepaid Rent (or Prepaid Expenses,) which is a current asset.  During the three months of January 1 through March 31 (when the prepaid rent is expiring) the $3,000 prepayment must be moved from the balance sheet asset account to an income statement expense account. If the company issues monthly income statements, the company will prepare adjusting entries to move $1,000 each month from the Prepaid Rent account to Rent Expense. When a retailer purchases goods to be resold, the cost of the goods purchased, but not yet sold, will be deferred to the current asset account Inventory. When goods are sold, the retailer moves the cost of those goods from Inventory to the income statement as the  Cost of Goods Sold, which is an expense that is being matched with the related sales revenues.",
    "Definition of a Lease": "Typically, a lease is a written agreement between an owner of property (land, building, equipment, vehicle, etc.) and a person or business that will use the property for a stated period of time in exchange for a specified series of payments. The owner of the property is known as the lessor and the person using the property is the lessee. Some leases are for short periods of time with no intention of transferring ownership of the asset in exchange for the rent payments. Other leases may be for longer periods with the ownership of the asset transferring to the lessee for a small additional payment.",
    "Examples of Leases": "A person or business might lease a suite in a large building for a one-year period. The lease agreement states that the lessee will pay the lessor $1,200 per month. Clearly, the lessor (property owner) is not agreeing to transfer ownership of the unit to the lessee (tenant) at the end of the one-year lease. Another lease might involve a business leasing a forklift from a forklift dealer. This lease states that it is noncancelable and requires 60 monthly payments of $600 per month. After the 60th monthly payment, the business (lessee) may take ownership of the forklift truck by paying the forklift dealer (lessor) an additional $500.",
    "Types of Adjusting Entries": "Adjusting entries, which are required in order to have a company’s financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting, are often categorized into three types:",
    "Accruals": "Accruals or accrual adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to report amounts that have occurred in the current accounting period but were not yet entered into the general ledger accounts. An example is a retail store’s emergency plumbing repair on December 31, the last day of its accounting period. The repair occurred in the December accounting period but the bill will not be received until the January accounting period. As of December 31, the retailer needs an accrual adjusting entry so that its December financial statements will report the expense and the liability. Also on December 31, the plumbing company will need an accrual adjusting entry so that its financial statements will report the revenues and the receivables that were earned in December.",
    "Deferrals": "Deferrals or deferral adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to defer expenses and/or revenues that have already been recorded in the general ledger accounts. The reason is that some of the recorded amounts will actually be used up and/or earned in a future accounting period. An example is a retailer’s payment of $1,200 for six months of property insurance that was paid in advance. For instance, if the payment was made on December 1 for protection during the upcoming period of December 1 through May 31, the retailer’s December’s income statement should report Insurance Expense of $200 (the expired 1/6 of the $1,200) and the December 31 balance sheet should report Prepaid Insurance of $1,000 (a current asset that represents the unexpired 5/6 of $1,200). The amount used in the deferral adjusting entry should be whatever is necessary to get the proper amounts to appear on the financial statements. The insurance company must also make a deferral adjusting entry so that its December revenues will include only the $200 that was earned. Its December 31 balance sheet should show the unearned $1,000 as the current liability Deferred Premiums.",
    "Other": "Other adjusting entries will likely include:",
    "Definition of Net Method": "In accounting, the net method likely refers to the way a company records each vendor’s invoice that offers an early payment discount.",
    "Example of Net Method": "Assume that a company purchased $1,000 of goods on credit. The vendor’s invoice shows the amount of $1,000 along with credit terms of 2/10, net 30 days. This means the $1,000 is due within 30 days, but if the company pays the invoice within 10 days, only $980 needs to be paid. ($980 is the “net” of the $1,000 invoice amount minus the early payment discount of $20, which is 2% of $1,000.) Companies that use the net method will record the vendor’s invoice as follows: credit Accounts Payable for $980 and debit another account (Inventory, Purchases, etc.) for $980.  If the company’s policy is to pay all vendor invoices within the discount period, the net method will result in a more precise current liability amount on its balance sheet. It also means that the accounts and amounts recorded as debits will better reflect the historical cost principle. If a company uses the net method, but fails to remit the net amount within the discount period, the net method requires a debit entry to the expense Purchase Discounts Lost. In our example, if the company pays the invoice in 30 days, it is not entitled to the early payment discount and will therefore have to credit Cash for $1,000. The debit amounts include Accounts Payable for $980 and Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Any amount recorded in Purchase Discounts Lost informs management that its policy of paying within the discount period has been violated. Although the net method is theoretically better, it seems to be less efficient than recording vendor invoices at their stated amounts.",
    "Definition of Aging of Accounts Receivable": "The aging of accounts receivable sorts the amounts that a company is owed (from customers who had purchased goods or services on credit) into columns with headings such as: current, 1-30 days past due, 31-60 days past due, etc. A receivable that is current (not past due) is usually not a problem. However, when customers are past due it is a sign that they are experiencing some financial difficulties. The greater the amount of time they are past due, the greater the possibility they will not pay the amount they owe the company. Good accounting requires the company to have an  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts to report a credit balance for the estimated amount of the accounts receivable that will not be collected. When a company needs to adjust the credit balance in the Allowance account to a larger amount, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for the amount necessary to have a sufficient credit balance. ",
    "Example of the Aging of Accounts Receivable and Bad Debts Expense": "Assume that a company has a debit balance in Accounts Receivable of $120,000 and has a credit balance of $1,000 in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This indicates that the net realizable value of its accounts receivable is $119,000. When reviewing an aging of the accounts receivable, the company discovers it has more past due customers and estimates that $8,000 of the accounts receivable will never be collected. Therefore, the company must increase the credit balance in the Allowance account by $7,000 with an accounting entry that debits Bad Debt Expense for $7,000 and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $7,000. ",
    "2024 Annual Earnings Limit for Social Security Payroll Tax": "The maximum amount of an employee’s 2024 earnings (and a self-employed person’s net income) that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax is $168,600. This amount is also known as the Social Security annual wage limit, wage base, contribution and benefit base, ceiling, tax cap, and maximum taxable earnings. The maximum amount is adjusted annually based on a national average wage index.",
    "2025 Annual Earnings Limit for Social Security Payroll Tax": "For the calendar year 2025 (January 1 through December 31, 2025) the maximum amount of an employee’s earnings that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax is $176,100.",
    "An Employer Must Match Its Employees’ Social Security Payroll Taxes": "The annual earnings limit is used when computing each employee’s maximum Social Security tax as well as the employer’s Social Security payroll tax amounts. (The employer must remit to the U.S. government two times the Social Security payroll tax withholdings.)",
    "Does Sales Include Sales Tax?": "The amount of a company’s sales does not include the sales taxes collected by the seller. The reason is that the sales taxes included in the sales invoices are not revenues earned by the seller. Instead, the sales taxes are the state/local government’s revenues. The seller is merely acting as an agent that is required to collect and remit the sales taxes to the government. As a result, the sales taxes included in a company’s sales invoices are recorded in a current liability account such as Sales Taxes Payable. When the company remits the sales taxes to the state or local government, the balance in Sales Taxes Payable is reduced. Any unremitted balance in Sales Taxes Payable is reported in the current liability section of the company’s balance sheet.",
    "Sales vs Net Sales": "Assume that a company has sales invoices for the month amounting to $63,000. The sales invoices represent the goods shipped to customers and includes $1,000 of sales taxes pertaining to its retail customers. The company offers credit terms of 1/10, net 30 days and some customers paid within 10 days and were granted early payment discounts of $300. The company also granted allowances of $200 to customers who received damaged goods or had been given a price adjustment. Given the above information, the company’s sales are calculated as follows:\nSales invoices with a total of $63,000 minus $1,000 of sales taxes that were included as required by the state/local government = the company’s sales of $62,000. Sales are also referred to as gross sales. The company’s net sales are calculated as follows:\nSales (or gross sales) of $62,000 minus early payment discounts of $300 and sales allowances of $200 = the company’s net sales of $61,500.",
    "Examples of Depreciation Methods": "For our comparison of some of the depreciation methods, assume that a company purchased a new plant asset at a cost of $100,000 that will have an estimated salvage value of $10,000 at the end of its useful life. This means that the total amount of depreciation will be $90,000 (which is referred to as the depreciable cost). The asset is expected to be useful for 5 years or the production of 100,000 units of output. The asset is placed into service on January 1, 2022, and the company’s accounting year is January 1 through December 31.",
    "Straight-Line Method": "Depreciable cost of $90,000 divided by 5 years = $18,000 of depreciation each year for 5 years. Download our Straight-line Method Form and Template.",
    "Units-of-Production Method": "Depreciable cost of $90,000 divided by 100,000 units = $0.90 per unit. In 2022, the company produces 12,000 units X $0.90 = $10,800 of depreciation. In 2023, the company produces 30,000 units X $0.90 = $27,000 of depreciation. Continue until the accumulated depreciation reaches $90,000. Download our Units-of-Activity (Production) Method Form and Template.",
    "Double-Declining-Balance Method": "The straight-line depreciation rate is 20% (100% divided by 5 years). Double the straight-line rate = 40% (20% X 2). This rate is applied to the book value of the asset at the beginning of each year. (Book value is the asset’s cost minus its accumulated depreciation.) For the year 2022, the double-declining-balance depreciation is: beginning book value of $100,000 X 40% = $40,000. For the year 2023, the calculation is: beginning book value of $60,000 X 40% = $24,000. Continue until the accumulated depreciation reaches $90,000. Download our Double-Declining-Balance Method Form and Template.",
    "Sum-of-the-Years’-Digits Method": "Add the digits in the years of useful life: 5+4+3+2+1 = 15. In the first year (2022), multiply 5/15 times the depreciable cost of $90,000 = $30,000 of depreciation. In 2023, multiply 4/15 times $90,000 = $24,000. In 2024, multiply 3/15 times $90,000, and so on. ",
    "Definition of Recognize an Expense": "To recognize an expense means to report the proper amount of an expense on the income statement for the appropriate accounting period.",
    "Use of Adjusting Entries": "Companies use adjusting entries in order for their income statements and balance sheets to be reporting the proper amounts in the appropriate accounting periods under the accrual method of accounting. ",
    "Definition of 2/10": "2/10 is part of an early payment discount that allows a customer or client to pay after the sale or service has been provided. This sales discount allows the customer/client to deduct 2% of the amount owed if the amount is paid within 10 days of the sale, service, or date of the sales invoice.",
    "Example of 2/10": "Assume that a company is in an industry with credit terms of net 30 days. This means the amount owed by the customer is due within 30 days of the sale or service. Often the customers do not remit until after 30 days. To improve the collection of the money owed to the company (part of the company’s accounts receivable and the customer’s accounts payable), the company’s invoice may state credit terms such as 2/10, net 30. For example, assume a company sells $3,000 of merchandise to a customer on December 3. The company’s sales invoice indicates credit terms of 2/10, net 30. This means that the customer’s $3,000 obligation will be eliminated if the customer remits $2,940 by December 13. If the customer pays on January 13, the full amount of $3,000 must be paid. If the company’s terms were 1/10, net 30 the early payment discount will be 1% of the amount owed if paid  within 10 days of the sale, service, or date of the sales invoice.",
    "Definition of Cash Dividends": "Cash dividends are a distribution of a corporation’s earnings to its stockholders or shareholders. For cash dividends to occur, the corporation’s board of directors must declare the dividends.",
    "Examples of How Cash Dividends Affect the Financial Statements": "When a corporation’s board of directors declares a cash dividend on its stock, the following will occur:",
    "Recording Money to Start a Sole Proprietorship": "If Amy Ott begins a sole proprietorship by putting money into her business, the sole proprietorship will debit Cash and will credit the Amy Ott, Capital.  If Amy Ott also lends some money to the business, the entry will be to debit Cash and credit a liability account such as Notes Payable. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the business will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset.)",
    "Recording Money to Start a Corporation": "If Amy Ott decided to form a regular corporation and invest cash in exchange for shares of the new corporation’s common stock, Cash will be debited and the account Common Stock will be credited. (If the common stock has a par value, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par is also used.) If Amy also lends cash to the corporation, Cash will be debited and the liability account Notes Payable to Stockholder will be credited. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the corporation will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset, unless the fair value of the common stock being issued has a more clear value.) You should consult with your accounting and tax professional as well as an attorney regarding the type of business structure to be used and the pros and cons of investing versus lending to a new business.",
    "Definition of Expanded Accounting Equation": "The expanded accounting equation provides more details for the owner’s equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a sole proprietorship is: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Owner’s Draws. The expanded accounting equation for a corporation provides more details for the stockholders’ equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a corporation is: Assets = Liabilities + Paid-in Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Dividends – Treasury Stock. The expanded accounting equation allows you to see separately (1) the impact on equity from net income (increased by revenues, decreased by expenses), and (2) the effect of transactions with owners (draws, dividends, sale or purchase of ownership interest).",
    "Definition of Stockholders’ Equity": "Stockholders’ equity (also known as shareholders’ equity) is reported on a corporation’s balance sheet and its amount is the difference between the amount of the corporation’s assets and its liabilities. Generally, stockholders’ equity consists of the amounts the corporation had received from the sale of its common and preferred shares of stock plus the earnings of the corporation minus any distributions to the stockholders. In other words, stockholders’ equity is one source of the corporation’s assets. (The other source are the corporation’s creditors as evidenced by the liabilities.)  Stockholders’ equity and liabilities are also seen as the claims to the corporation’s assets. However, the stockholders’ claim comes after the liabilities have been paid. Stockholders’ equity is also the corporation’s total book value (which is different from the corporation’s worth or market value).",
    "Components of Stockholders’ Equity": "The amount of stockholders’ equity is reported on the balance sheet as follows:",
    "Definition of Equity Section of the Balance Sheet": "The equity section of the balance sheet is known as:",
    "Examples of Negative Amounts in the Equity Section": "If the current year’s net income is reported as a separate line in the owner’s equity or stockholders’ equity sections of the balance sheet, a negative amount of net income must be reported. The negative net income occurs when the current year’s revenues are less than the current year’s expenses. If the cumulative earnings minus the cumulative dividends declared result in a negative amount, there will be a negative amount of retained earnings. This negative (or positive) amount of retained earnings is reported as a separate line within stockholders’ equity. The owner’s drawing account in a sole proprietorship will have a debit balance. Hence, if it is reported as a separate line, it is reported as a negative amount since the owner’s equity section of the balance sheet normally has credit balances. If a corporation has purchased its own shares of stock the cost is recorded as a debit in the account Treasury Stock. The debit balance will be reported as a negative amount in the stockholders’ equity section, since this section normally has credit balances.  Accumulated other comprehensive income can also be a negative (or positive) amount.",
    "Example of Main Difference Between Nonprofit and For-Profit Balance Sheets": "A nonprofit or not-for-profit (NFP) organization’s balance sheet is known as the Statement of Financial Position and this name will appear in the heading of this important and required financial statement. (The heading for a for-profit corporation usually shows the name Balance Sheet.)  A main difference between the NFP’s statement of financial position and the for-profit corporation’s balance sheet is the equity section:",
    "Definition of Merchandise Received but Not Vendor’s Invoice": "If a retailer receives merchandise from one of its vendors, but has not received the vendor’s  invoice, the company has the current asset, inventory, but will not have recorded the current liability, accounts payable. The accounts payable person/department will have the retailer’s purchase order and receiving ticket/record, but is awaiting the vendor’s invoice to complete the three-way match in order to record the transaction in the retailer’s general ledger account Accounts Payable.",
    "Example of Recording a Liability without the Vendor’s Invoice": "At any time, the retailer’s accounts payable clerk/department will have many transactions waiting to be recorded in Accounts Payable or Vouchers Payable. This is not a problem as long as financial statements are not issued. However, at the end of the accounting period (prior to issuing the company’s financial statements) the retailer will have to prepare an accrual adjusting entry to record the amounts owed to vendors but not yet recorded. The accrual adjusting entry will 1) debit Purchases (periodic method) or Inventory (perpetual method) for the cost of the goods or merchandise received, and 2) credit a current liability account such as Accrued Liabilities. After the financial reporting for the accounting period is completed, the retailer will typically record a reversing entry to remove the accrual adjusting entry that was recorded prior to issuing the financial statements.",
    "Definition of Book Value per Share of Stock": "The book value of a corporation is the amount of its stockholders’ equity. Assuming the corporation does not have preferred stock outstanding, the book value per share of common stock is the amount of the corporation’s stockholders’ equity  divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding on that date. Both the amount of stockholders’ equity and the number of shares of common stock outstanding are reported on the corporation’s balance sheet. Since a corporation’s stockholders’ equity is the difference between the total amount of assets and the total amount of liabilities as reported on the balance sheet, the corporation’s book value is not the market value of the corporation. Two reasons for the difference are the following:",
    "Example of Book Value per Share of Stock": "If a corporation without preferred stock has stockholders’ equity on December 31 of $12,421,000 and it has 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding on that date, the book value per share of common stock is $12.42. This book value is likely to be far different from the market value of a share of the common stock.",
    "Definition of Accrual Basis of Accounting": "Under the accrual basis of accounting (or accrual method of accounting), revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned. When the revenues are earned but cash is not received, the asset accounts receivable will be recorded. (Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues are not reported on the income statement until the cash is received.) Also under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are reported on the income statement when they match up with the revenues being reported, or when a cost has no future benefit that can be measured. When an expense occurs and cash has not yet been paid, a liability account will also be recorded. (The expenses that were not paid in the current accounting period will be reported through adjusting entries.) In other words, under the accrual basis of accounting, the receipt of cash and the payment of cash are not the focus of reporting revenues and expenses. Rather the focus is: 1) what revenues were earned, and 2) what expenses were incurred. Therefore, the accrual basis of accounting provides a more accurate measure of a company’s profitability during an accounting period, and a more accurate picture of a company’s assets and liabilities at the end of an accounting period.",
    "Example of Reporting Revenues Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting": "Let’s assume that I begin an accounting business in December and during December I provided $10,000 of accounting services. Since I allow clients to pay in 30 days, none of the $10,000 of fees that I earned in December were received in December. Rather, my clients paid the $10,000 in January. Under the accrual basis of accounting my business will report the $10,000 of revenues I earned on the December income statement and will report accounts receivable of $10,000 on the December 31 balance sheet.",
    "Example of Reporting Expenses Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting": "Now let’s assume that I paid office rent of $1,500 and incurred $300 of costs for electricity, gas, and sewer/water during December. However, the utilities will not read the meters until January 1, will bill me on January 10 and require that I pay the bill by February 1. Under the accrual basis of accounting I will report the rent expense in December because the rent was used up in December, and I will also report estimated utilities expense of $300 so that the December income statement provides a better measure of December’s profitability. Also the December 31 balance sheet will report a liability such as utilities payable of $300 to communicate a more accurate measure of obligations at December 31.",
    "Comparing Accrual Basis to Cash Basis": "Using the transactions above, the accrual basis of accounting will result in the December income statement reporting revenues of $10,000 and expenses of $1,800 for a net income of $8,200. Using the cash basis of accounting the December income statement will report $0 revenues and expenses of $1,500 for a net loss of $1,500 even though I had earned $10,000 in accounting fees. Further, the balance sheet will not report the obligation for the utilities that were used. The January income statement will report the collection of the fees earned in December, and the February income statement will report the expense of using the December utilities. Hence, the cash basis of accounting can be misleading to the readers of the financial statements. For financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",
    "Definition of Capital Expenditure": "A capital expenditure is an amount spent to acquire or significantly improve the capacity or capabilities of a long-term asset such as equipment or buildings. Usually the cost is recorded in a balance sheet account that is reported under the heading of Property, Plant and Equipment. The asset’s cost (except for the cost of land) will then be allocated to depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset. The amount of each period’s depreciation expense is also credited to the contra-asset account Accumulated Depreciation.",
    "Examples of Capital Expenditures": "Capital expenditures include the amounts spent to acquire or make significant improvements to land, buildings, machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, computer information systems, leasehold improvements, etc.",
    "Examples of Revenue Expenditures": "Examples of revenue expenditures include the amounts spent on repairs and maintenance, selling, general and administrative expenses. ",
    "Definition of Matching Principle": "The matching principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. The matching principle directs a company to report an expense on its income statement in the period in which the related revenues are earned. Further, it results in a liability to appear on the balance sheet for the end of the accounting period. The matching principle is associated with the accrual basis of accounting and adjusting entries. If an expense is not directly tied to revenues, the expense should be reported on the income statement in the accounting period in which it expires or is used up. If the future benefit of a cost cannot be determined, it should be charged to expense immediately.",
    "Examples of the Matching Principle": "To illustrate the matching principle, let’s assume that a company’s sales are made entirely through sales representatives (reps) who earn a 10% commission. The commissions are paid on the 15th day of the month following the calendar month of the sales. For instance, if the company has $60,000 of sales in December, the company will pay commissions of $6,000 on January 15. The matching principle requires that $6,000 of commissions expense be reported on the December income statement along with the related December sales of $60,000. It also requires that the December 31 balance sheet report a current liability of $6,000. This is referred to as an accrual and is achieved through an adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Commissions Expense for $6,000 and credits Commissions Payable for $6,000. (Without the matching principle and the adjusting entry, the company might report the $6,000 of commissions expense in January rather than in December when the expense and the liability were incurred.) A retailer’s or a manufacturer’s cost of goods sold is another example of an expense that is matched with sales through a cause and effect relationship. Not all costs and expenses have a cause and effect relationship with revenues. Hence, the matching principle may require a systematic allocation of a cost to the accounting periods in which the cost is used up. Hence, if a company purchases an elaborate office system for $252,000 that will be useful for 84 months, the company should report $3,000 of depreciation expense on each of its monthly income statements. If the future benefit of a cost cannot be determined, it should be charged to expense immediately. For example, the entire cost of a television advertisement that is shown during the Olympics will be charged to advertising expense in the year that the ad is shown.",
    "Definition of Double Declining Balance Method of Depreciation": "The double declining balance method of depreciation, also known as the 200% declining balance method of depreciation, is a  form of accelerated depreciation. This means that compared to the straight-line method, the depreciation expense will be faster in the early years of the asset’s life but slower in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation expense during the life of the assets will be the same.  The “double” means 200% of the straight line rate of depreciation, while the “declining balance” refers to the asset’s book value or carrying value at the beginning of the accounting period. Since book value is an asset’s cost minus its accumulated depreciation, the asset’s book value will be decreasing when the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited with the depreciation expense of the accounting period.",
    "Example of Double Declining Balance Depreciation": "Let’s assume that a retailer purchases fixtures on January 1 at a cost of $100,000. It is expected that the fixtures will have no salvage value at the end of their useful life of 10 years. Under the straight-line method, the 10-year life means the asset’s annual depreciation will be 10% of the asset’s cost. Under the double declining balance method the 10% straight line rate is doubled to 20%. However, the 20% is multiplied times the fixture’s book value at the beginning of the year instead of the fixture’s original cost. At the beginning of the first year, the fixture’s book value is $100,000 since the fixtures have not yet had any depreciation. Therefore, under the double declining balance method the $100,000 of book value will be multiplied by 20% and will result in $20,000 of depreciation for Year 1. The journal entry will be a debit of $20,000 to Depreciation Expense and a credit of $20,000 to Accumulated Depreciation. At the beginning of the second year, the fixture’s book value will be $80,000, which is the cost of $100,000 minus the accumulated depreciation of $20,000. When the $80,000 is multiplied by 20% the result is $16,000 of depreciation for Year 2. At the beginning of Year 3, the asset’s book value will be $64,000. This is the fixture’s cost of $100,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $36,000 ($20,000 + $16,000). The book value of $64,000 multiplied by 20% is $12,800 of depreciation expense for Year 3. At the beginning of Year 4, the asset’s book value will be $51,200. Therefore, the book value of $51,200 multiplied by 20% will result in $10,240 of depreciation expense for Year 4. At the beginning of Year 5, the asset’s book value will be $40,960. This is the amount to be depreciated over the remaining 6 years. In year 5, companies often switch to straight-line depreciation and debit Depreciation Expense and credit Accumulated Depreciation for $6,827 ($40,960/6 years) in each of the six remaining years.",
    "Definition of Absorption Costing": "Absorption costing (also known as full absorption costing) indicates that all of the manufacturing costs have been assigned to (absorbed by) the units of goods produced. In other words, the cost of a finished product includes the following costs:",
    "Definition of Goodwill": "In accounting, goodwill is an intangible asset associated with a business combination. Goodwill is recorded when a company acquires (purchases) another company and the purchase price is greater than 1) the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, minus 2) the liabilities that were assumed. Goodwill is reported on the balance sheet as a long-term or noncurrent asset. Since 2001, U.S. companies are no longer required to amortize the recorded amount of goodwill. However, the amount of goodwill is subject to a goodwill impairment test at least once per year. (Beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.) Outside of accounting, goodwill might be referring to some value that has been built up within a company as a result of delivering amazing customer service, unique management, teamwork, etc. However, this goodwill is unrelated to a business combination and cannot be recorded or reported on the company’s balance sheet.",
    "Example of Goodwill": "Let’s assume that Company A acquires Business X for $5 million based on Business X’s annual net income X 10. The fair value of Business X’s identifiable assets was $4 million and its liabilities were $1 million. Therefore, Company A is paying $5 million for identifiable assets and liabilities having a value of $3 million ($4 million of assets minus $1 million of liabilities). When Company A records the transaction, it will:",
    "Definition of Accrued Vacation Pay": "Accrued vacation pay is the amount of vacation pay that a company’s employees have earned, but the company has not yet paid.",
    "Example of Accrued Vacation Pay": "Let’s assume that a company has a formal agreement that provides its employees with 120 hours of paid vacation in the year following the employees’ full-time employment. Let’s also assume that the company has only one full-time employee who began working at the company on January 1 of the current year and has an hourly pay rate of $26. In the current year, this employee will earn vacation pay of $3,120 (120 hours x $26), or $60 per week ($3,120 per year divided by 52 weeks). This means that in the current year the company must record vacation pay expense and a related liability at a rate of $60 per week. In our example, the company has only the one full-time employee, so the company’s December 31 balance sheet must report a current liability of $3,120. Vacation pay is an example of an accrued expense and an accrued liability that is required by the matching principle.",
    "Definition of the Write-off of a Bad Account": "The write-off of a bad account usually refers to eliminating an account receivable due to the customer’s inability to pay the amount owed. The entry to write off a bad account depends on whether the company is using the direct write-off method or the allowance method.",
    "Examples of the Write-off of a Bad Account": "Under the direct write-off method a company writes off a bad account receivable when a specific account is determined to be uncollectible. This usually occurs many months after the credit sale occurred. The entry to write off the bad account under the direct write-off method is:",
    "Definition of Long-term Liability": "A long-term liability is an obligation resulting from a previous event that is not due within one year of the date of the balance sheet (or not due within the company’s operating cycle if it is longer than one year). Long-term liabilities are also known as noncurrent liabilities.",
    "Examples of Long-term Liabilities": "Some examples of long-term liabilities are the noncurrent portions of the following:",
    "Example of Working Capital": "Assume that a company’s balance sheet of December 31 reports current assets of $450,000 and current liabilities of $320,000. The working capital at the final instant of December 31 is $130,000 ($450,000 – $320,000). Even with a significant amount of working capital, a company can experience a cash shortage if its current assets are not turning to cash. For example, if a company has most of its current assets in the form of inventory and sales slow and customers take more time to pay the amounts they owe, the company may not have the cash needed to meet its payroll or to pay other current liabilities when they come due. It is important for a company to monitor all of its current assets so that the cash keeps flowing into the company’s checking account.",
    "Additional Comments on Working Capital": "The adequacy of a company’s working capital depends on the industry in which it competes, its relationship with its customers and suppliers, and other factors such as the following:",
    "Definition of Impairment": "The term impairment is associated with an asset currently having a market value that is less than the asset’s book value . A test is done to determine whether the asset’s book value should be reduced to the current market value and to report the amount of the write-down (reduction) as a loss on its income statement.",
    "Examples of Impairment": "A meat packing plant in recent years invested large amounts in its plant and equipment. Since then, the company experienced a dramatic decline in the demand for its products and in the value of its plant and equipment. If the required test of impairment indicates that a loss must be recorded on its plant and equipment, its book value must be reduced and the resulting loss reported on its income statement. A second example is Corporation X that acquired another company. The amount paid for the company resulted in Corporation X reporting a large amount for the intangible asset goodwill. Since the acquisition, the acquired company’s value has declined to only a small fraction of the amount currently reported as goodwill. A test must be done and it may require a reduction in the reported amount of goodwill and a resulting impairment loss reported on the company’s income statement.",
    "Definition of Units of Production Depreciation": "The units of production method of depreciation (which is also referred to as the units of activity method) assumes that an asset’s useful life is more related to its usage rather than the mere passage of time. Under the units of production method, depreciation during a given year will be greater when there is a higher volume of activity. In times of low usage the asset’s depreciation will be less.",
    "Example of Calculating Units of Production Depreciation": "To illustrate the units of production method, let’s assume that a company has a machine with a cost of $500,000 and a useful life that is expected to end after producing 240,000 units of a component part. Further, the machine’s salvage value at that point is assumed to be $20,000. Given the above assumptions, the amount to be depreciated is $480,000 ($500,000 minus $20,000). Dividing the $480,000 by the machine’s useful life of 240,000 units, the depreciation will be $2 per unit. If the machine produces 10,000 units in the first year, the depreciation for the year will be $20,000 ($2 x 10,000 units). If the machine produces 50,000 units in the next year, the depreciation will be $100,000 ($2 x 50,000 units). The depreciation will be calculated similarly each year until the asset’s  Accumulated Depreciation reaches $480,000. The units of production method or units of activity method could be useful for depreciating airplanes and vehicles (based on miles used), printing machines (based on pages run), DVDs (based on number of times rented), etc.",
    "Recording a Contingent Liability": "A potential or contingent liability that is both probable and the amount can be estimated is recorded as 1) an expense or loss on the income statement, and 2) a liability on the balance sheet. ",
    "Disclosing a Contingent Liability": "A loss contingency which is possible but not probable will not be recorded in the accounts as a liability and a loss. Rather, it will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. A loss contingency that is probable or possible but the amount cannot be estimated means the amount cannot be recorded in the company’s accounts or reported as liability on the balance sheet. Instead, the contingent liability will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. ",
    "Not Reporting or Disclosing a Contingent Liability": "A loss contingency that is remote  will not be recorded and it will not have to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. An example is a nuisance lawsuit where there is no similar case that was ever successful.",
    "Example of Recording a Contingent Liability": "Product warranties are often cited as a contingent liability that meets both of the required conditions (probable and the amount can be estimated). Product warranties will be recorded at the time of the products’ sales by debiting Warranty Expense and crediting to Warranty Liability for the estimated amount.",
    "Definition of Loan Costs": "Loan costs may include legal and accounting fees, registration fees, appraisal fees, processing fees, etc. that were necessary costs in order to obtain a loan. If the loan costs are significant, they must be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan because of the matching principle.",
    "Example of Amortizing Loan Costs": "Assume that a company incurs loan costs of $120,000 during February in order to obtain a $4 million loan at an annual interest rate of 9%. The loan will begin on March 1 and the entire $4 million of principal will be due five years later. In addition to the one-time loan costs of $120,000 the company will also have the cost of the borrowed money which is $360,000 ($4 million X 9%) of interest each year for five years. It would be misleading to report the entire $120,000 of loan costs as an expense for the month of February. Hence, the matching principle requires that each month during the life of the loan the company should report $2,000 ($120,000 divided by 60 months) of loan costs as interest expense in addition to the interest expense of $30,000 per month ($4 million X 9% per year = $360,000 per year divided by 12 months per year). The combination of the monthly amortization of $2,000 and the monthly interest expense of $30,000 results in total monthly interest expense of $32,000 for each of the 60 months beginning on March 1. When the note is issued and the loan costs are incurred, the company will debit a liability account such as Deferred Debt Issuance Costs for $120,000. This account balance is presented along with the $4,000,000 credit balance in Notes Payable. The result will be an initial net long-term liability of $3,880,00 and a net cash increase of $3,880,000. Each month the company will amortize the debt issue costs by crediting Deferred Debt Issue Costs for $2,000 and debiting Interest Expense for $2,000.",
    "Definition of Goods in Transit": "Goods in transit refers to inventory items and other products that have been shipped by a seller, but have not yet reached the purchaser. When goods are in transit at the end of an accounting period, they require special accounting attention since the goods are not physically present at either the seller’s or the buyer’s location. It is necessary to examine whether the sales terms were FOB shipping point or FOB destination. The rules to be followed are:",
    "Example of Goods in Transit": "Let’s assume that both a company (seller) and its customer (buyer) have accounting periods which end on December 31. The company ships a truckload of merchandise on December 30 to a customer who is located 2,000 miles away.  The merchandise arrives at the customer’s location on January 2. Between December 30 and January 2, the merchandise is an example of goods in transit.  If the terms are FOB shipping point, the company (seller) will record a sale and receivable as of December 30, and will not include the goods in transit as its December 31 inventory. On December 31, the customer (buyer) is the owner of the goods in transit and will need to report a purchase, a payable, and must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory cost. If the terms of the sale are FOB destination, the company (seller) will not have a sale and receivable until January 2. This means the company (seller) must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory as of December 31. [The customer (buyer) will not have a purchase, payable, or inventory of the goods as of December 31. The customer’s (buyer’s) purchase, payable, and increase in inventory will occur on January 2.]",
    "Definition of Capitalized Interest": "Capitalized interest is the interest on debt that was used to finance a self-constructed, long-term asset. The capitalized interest for the company’s self-constructed asset involves the following:",
    "Example of Capitalized Interest": "Assume that a company is constructing an addition to its present manufacturing building. Its bank is lending the company $320,000 at an annual interest rate of 6% to cover 80% of the building addition’s cost. The remaining 20% will be paid from the company’s present cash balance. Also assume that the company’s building materials, labor and overhead will amount to $400,000 during the three months of construction. The capitalized interest is based on the 6% loan of $320,000 and the accumulated construction expenditures during the three-month construction period. The maximum amount of capitalized interest will be $320,000 X 6% X 3/12 = $4,800. If this ends up being the amount of capitalized interest, the asset’s cost will be $404,800 which will be depreciated over the building’s remaining useful life.",
    "Definition of Comprehensive Income": "Comprehensive income for a corporation is the combination of the following amounts which occurred during a specified period of time such as a year, quarter, month, etc.:",
    "Accounting for a Project Under Construction": "If a company is constructing a major project such as a building, assembly line, etc., the amounts spent on the project will be debited to a long-term asset account categorized as Construction Work-in-Progress. Construction Work-in-Progress is often reported as the last line within the balance sheet classification Property, Plant and Equipment. There is no depreciation of the accumulated costs until the project is completed and the asset is placed into service. When the completed asset is placed into service, the project’s accumulated costs will be removed from the Construction Work-in-Progress account and will be debited to the appropriate plant asset account.",
    "Dividing the Cost of Real Estate into Land and Building": "In accounting, the cost of real estate must be divided into:",
    "Example of Dividing the Cost of Real Estate": "Assume that a company purchases real estate (which includes land and a building) at a cost of $220,000. The appraisal at the time of the purchase indicates that the land has a market value of $50,000 and the building has a market value of $200,000…for a total market value of $250,000. In other words, the appraisal indicates that the land is 20% ($50,000/$250,000) of the market value, and the building is 80% ($200,000/$250,000) of the market value. The cost principle requires that the purchase be recorded at its cost of $220,000. However, we can use the appraisal amounts as a logical way to divide up the cost of $220,000 between land and building. Here is one approach:",
    "Definition of Contingent Asset": "A contingent asset is a potential asset that is associated with a potential gain. The asset and gain are contingent because they are dependent upon some future event occurring or not occurring. Because of the concept of conservatism, a contingent asset and gain will not be recorded in a general ledger account or reported on the financial statements until they are certain. [This is different from contingent liabilities and contingent losses, which are recorded in accounts and reported on the financial statements when they are probable and the amount can be estimated.",
    "Example of Contingent Asset": "An example of a contingent asset (and its related contingent gain) is a lawsuit filed by Company A against a competitor for infringing on Company A’s patent. Even if it is probable (but not certain) that Company A will win the lawsuit, it is a contingent asset and a contingent gain. As such, it will not be recorded in Company A’s general ledger accounts until the lawsuit is settled. (At most, Company A could prepare a carefully worded disclosure stating that it has filed the lawsuit but the outcome is uncertain.)",
    "Definition of Cost Incurred": "A cost incurred is a cost that a company (or other organization) becomes liable for.",
    "Example of Cost Incurred": "Assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and its electric meter is read by the utility on the last day of every month. During December the retailer will have incurred the cost of the electricity it used during December. Under the accrual basis of accounting the retailer must report a current liability on December 31 for the amount owed to the utility for the electricity it used to that point. On its income statement for December, the retailer must also report electricity expense for the cost of the electricity that it used during December. This may require the retailer to record an accrual adjusting entries with an estimated amount (if the electricity bill is not received in time).",
    "Definition of Cost Flow Assumptions": "The term cost flow assumptions refers to the manner in which costs are removed from a company’s inventory and are reported as the cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average. (If specific identification is used, there is no need to make an assumption.) FIFO, LIFO, average are assumptions because the flow of costs out of inventory does not have to match the way the items were physically removed from inventory.",
    "Example of Cost Flow Assumptions": "To illustrate, let’s assume that a company has four units of the same product in its inventory. The units were purchased at increasing costs and in the following sequence: $40, $41, $43, and $44. If the company physically removes and sells the oldest unit (the unit that had a cost of $40), the cost removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold (COGS) will vary depending on the cost flow assumption:",
    "Definition of Consistency": "In accounting, consistency requires that a company’s financial statements follow the same accounting principles, methods, practices and procedures from one accounting period to the next. This allows the readers of the financial statements to make meaningful comparisons between years. Consistency does allow a company to make a change to a more preferred accounting method. However, the change and its effects must be clearly disclosed for the benefit of the readers of the financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board refers to consistency as one of the characteristics or qualities that makes accounting information useful.",
    "Example of Consistency": "Let’s assume that a U.S. corporation uses the FIFO cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and determining its cost of goods sold. Due to the increasing cost of its materials, it concludes that LIFO will better indicate the company’s true profit. In the year of the change from FIFO to LIFO (and in years when comparisons are presented), the company must disclose the break in consistency. ",
    "Definition of Direct Labor": "Direct labor refers to the employees and temporary staff who work directly on a manufacturer’s products. (People working in the production area, but not directly on the products, are referred to as indirect labor.) The direct labor cost includes the wages and fringe benefits of the direct labor employees and the cost of the temporary staff that are working directly on the manufacturer’s products. The direct labor cost is classified as the following:",
    "Definition of Monetary Unit Assumption": "The monetary unit assumption as it applies to a U.S. corporation is that the U.S.dollar (USD) is stable in the long run. That is, the USD does not lose its purchasing power. Note that this is the assumption. As a result of the monetary unit assumption, accountants at a U.S. corporation do not hesitate to add the cost of a parcel of land purchased in 2024 to the cost of another parcel of land that had been purchased in 2004. (See example below.) Another part of the monetary unit assumption is that U.S. accountants report a corporation’s assets as dollar amounts (rather than reporting details of all of the assets). If an asset cannot be expressed as a dollar amount, it cannot be entered in a general ledger account. For example, the management team of a very successful corporation may be the corporation’s most valuable asset. However, the accountant is not able to objectively convert those talented people into USDs. Hence, the management team will not be included in the reported amounts on the balance sheet.",
    "Example of Monetary Unit Assumption": "Let’s illustrate the monetary unit assumption with a hypothetical example. Assume that a U.S. corporation purchased a two-acre parcel of land at a cost of $80,000 in 2004. Then in 2024 the corporation purchased an adjacent (nearly identical) two-acre parcel at a cost of $500,000. After the 2024 purchase is recorded, the balance in the corporation’s general ledger account Land is $580,000. Therefore, the corporation’s balance sheet will report its four acres of land at a cost of $580,000. There is no adjustment for the difference in purchasing power between the 2004 dollar and the 2024 dollar.",
    "Definition of Notes to Financial Statements": "The notes to the financial statements are a required, integral part of a company’s external financial statements. They are required since not all relevant financial information can be communicated through the amounts shown (or not shown) on the face of the financial statements. The notes are also referred to as footnote disclosures. Generally, the notes are the main method for a company to comply with the full disclosure principle.",
    "Example of Notes to Financial Statements": "The first note to the financial statements is usually a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies for the use of estimates, revenue recognition, inventories, property and equipment,  goodwill and other intangible assets, fair value measurement, discontinued operations, foreign currency translation, recently issued accounting pronouncements, and others. The remaining notes contain the details (including schedules of amounts) for items such as inventories, accrued liabilities, income taxes, employee benefit plans, leases, business segment information, fair value measurements, derivative instruments and hedging, stock options, commitments and contingencies, and more.  Each external financial statement should also include a reference to the notes, such as: The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.",
    "Definition of Amortize Goodwill": "Prior to 2001, to  amortize goodwill meant to consistently and in uniform increments move the reported amount of the intangible asset goodwill from the balance sheet to the income statement  over a period not to exceed 40 years. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which ended the automatic amortization of goodwill to expense on the income statement.  Today, the amount of goodwill reported on the balance sheet must be reviewed annually to see if there is an impairment, and potentially record an impairment loss. Private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.",
    "Definition of Conservatism Principle": "In accounting, the conservatism principle (or accounting constraint) directs an accountant, who is faced with doubt between two possible alternatives, to choose the alternative that will result in one or more of the following:",
    "Example of Conservatism in Accounting": "One example of conservatism is the accounting rule for reporting inventory on a company’s balance sheet. The accounting rule requires inventory to be reported at the lower of its cost or its net realizable value (NRV). The amount of the inventory write-down is reported on the current income statement.  To illustrate, assume that a company has inventory with a cost of $15,000. However, the market for the goods has declined. As a result, the goods in inventory can be sold for $14,000, but only if the company spends an additional $2,000 to package and ship the goods. If the inventory is not sold, the accountant is faced with two alternatives for the company’s next balance sheet:",
    "Definition of Rent Payable": "Rent Payable is a liability account in the general ledger of the tenant which reports the amount of rent owed as the date of the balance sheet.",
    "Example of Rent Receivable and Rent Payable": "For simplicity, assume that the landlord owns just one property and the tenant pays rent only to this landlord. Both parties use the accrual method of accounting and issue monthly financial statements. The rent is $2,000 per month and it is due on the first day of each month. If the rent is paid when due, the landlord’s and tenant’s balance sheets as of the last day of every month will report zero balances in Rent Receivable and Rent Payable. However, if the tenant has not paid the June rent as of June 30, the landlord will report Rent Receivable of $2,000 and the tenant will report Rent Payable of $2,000.",
    "Definition of Land Improvement": "A land improvement is a long-term (long-lived) asset resulting from a physical addition to a company’s land. The cost of a land improvement is recorded in the general ledger account Land Improvements. Unlike the land, a land improvement has a limited useful life and therefore the cost of the improvement is depreciated over the useful life of the improvement.",
    "Examples of Land Improvements": "A few examples of land improvements include:",
    "Definition of a Leasehold Improvement": "A leasehold improvement is a permanent change to the property that a company (lessee/tenant) is leasing from the owner (lessor). The amount spent by the lessee/tenant is recorded in the long-term asset account Leasehold Improvements. Typically, the costs of the additions will be depreciated by the lessee/tenant over the useful life of the improvements or the remaining years of the lease, whichever is shorter.  ",
    "Example of a Leasehold Improvement": "An example of a leasehold improvement is the new walls and offices that the lessee makes to a warehouse that it leases from the owner (lessor). The lease states that all improvements to the building will belong to the owner of the building. If the walls and offices cost $90,000 and are expected to be useful for 15 years, but the lease expires at the end of 12 years, the company’s (lessee’s) financial statements will report depreciation expense of $7,500 in each of the 12 years remaining on the lease.",
    "Definition of Assessed Value": "Assessed value will likely be the amount that a local or state government has designated for individual properties. This assessed value is used in determining the amount of property tax that the property owner will be assessed and will owe.",
    "Example of Assessed Value": "Assume that a company’s warehouse is located in a city. The city tax assessor is responsible for determining the assessed value for every parcel of land and every building within the city. The city government then establishes a real estate tax rate to be applied to the assessed values. (There could also be assessed values for personal property.) The assessed values of real estate or personal property are not necessarily equal to the property’s current market value.",
    "Definition of Appraised Value": "Appraised value is the amount (or amounts) contained in an appraisal report for a specific property. The appraisal report is generally prepared by a professional appraiser who looks at the property’s features including size, type of construction, location, condition, and recent sales of comparable property in the vicinity. The appraised value is an attempt to determine the property’s current market value. The appraisal report for real estate will usually report the appraised value of the land separate from the appraised value of the structures. An accountant might use the relationship of these appraised values to allocate the cost of real estate into the cost of the land and the cost of the buildings.",
    "Example of Appraised Value": "Appraised values are useful because a company’s balance sheet will report its land and buildings at the cost when they were acquired and will report the accumulated depreciation of the buildings. (Land is not depreciated.) Therefore, if the company wants to refinance its real estate, a current appraisal will usually be required.",
    "Definition of Interim Financial Statements": "Interim financial statements report amounts for time intervals that are shorter than a company’s annual financial statements. The interim financial statements give management, investors, and other users some updated information on the company’s operations and financial position. Unlike the annual financial statements, the interim financial statements will likely be unaudited and either condensed or more detailed depending on the distribution. Interim financial statements to stockholders (external financial statements) will be more condensed than the annual financial statements. Interim financial statements for the company’s management (internal financial statements) will be more detailed, but will omit the notes to the financial statements. ",
    "Examples of Interim Financial Statements": "A few examples of interim financial statements (other than the balance sheet) for a company with an accounting year ending on each December 31 will include the following in their headings:",
    "Definition of Long-term Debt": "In accounting, long-term debt generally refers to a company’s loans and other liabilities that will not become due within one year of the balance sheet date. (The amount that will be due within one year is reported on the balance sheet as a current liability.)",
    "Example of Long-term Debt": "Let’s assume that a company has a mortgage loan with a principal balance of $200,000 with 120 monthly payments remaining. The loan payments due in the next 12 months include $12,000 of principal payments. The $200,000 of debt should be reported on the company’s balance sheet as follows:",
    "Definition of Intangible Asset": "An intangible asset is an asset that you cannot touch, since it lacks physical substance. Accountants record intangible assets at their cost when they are acquired. Some intangible assets have a limited life and are amortized to expense over that life.  Other intangible assets have an unlimited life and are not amortized. However, their reported cost is reviewed annually. If there is an impairment loss, the amount on the balance sheet is reduced and the loss is reported on the income statement. Intangible assets can be some of the company’s most valuable assets. However, if they were developed by the company (as opposed to purchased from another company), there may be no amount to report on the balance sheet. ",
    "Examples of Intangible Assets": "Intangible assets include the following and more:",
    "Definition of Inventory Valuation": "In the U.S., inventory valuation is the dollar amount associated with the items remaining in a company’s inventory.  Generally speaking, the amount is the cost of the items. (Cost is defined as all of the costs necessary to get the inventory items in place and ready for sale.) The cost may vary somewhat since U.S. companies may choose between the periodic inventory system and the perpetual inventory system. In addition, these companies may select from several cost flow assumptions, including FIFO, LIFO, average, etc.  While reporting at cost is the general rule, inventories must be reported at less than cost in certain situations. For example, some inventories will have to be reported at their net realizable value when it is less than cost. A manufacturer’s inventory valuation will include the costs of production, namely direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Manufacturers are also required to consistently follow their selected cost flow assumption.",
    "Examples of Inventory Valuation": "Assume that a new company purchased three truckloads of its only merchandise item during its first year of operations at the following costs:",
    "Example of an Account Receivable": "Assume that Heating Repair Service (HRS) provides services for a customer on December 28 and allows the customer 10 days in which to pay its invoice of $850. On December 28, HRS records the $850 it has earned in the current asset account Accounts Receivable and in the revenue account Service Revenues. On HRS’s income statement for the period that includes December 28, the $850 of revenues minus the related expenses results in the amount of net income. ",
    "Effect from Collecting an Account Receivable": "Assume that on January 8, HRS receives the $850 from the customer whose furnace was repaired on December 28. The effect of HRS receiving the $850 is to increase the current asset Cash and to decrease the current asset Accounts Receivable. Note that no revenue is reported when the $850 is received on January 8 and there is no effect on HRS’s net income.  Remember there is a difference between receipts and revenues:",
    "Definition of Rent Expense": "Rent expense is often a monthly amount paid by a company for use of a building. Typically, the rent is due on the first day of every month that the building is occupied.",
    "Definition of a Period Cost": "A period cost is a cost that is used up or expires in the accounting period. As a result, the cost is reported as an expense on the income statement.",
    "Definition of a Product Cost": "A product cost is a cost that is either directly or indirectly assigned to the goods that are produced or manufactured by the company. Product costs are the raw materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead used to produce the goods. Think of product costs as clinging to the goods produced. The rent associated with the manufacturing operations is part of manufacturing overhead, which is allocated to the products manufactured. As a result, the allocated manufacturing cost will be included as part of the following costs:",
    "Examples of Rent as a Period Expense": "If a company’s monthly rent is for use of assets involved in its selling function (rent for office space, equipment, autos, etc.) or its administrative function of the company, the rent is a period cost and will be expensed in the period when the expense is incurred. These rents are not allocated to products for its external financial statements.",
    "Example of Rent as a Product Cost": "If a manufacturer rents its manufacturing facilities and equipment, the rent is a product cost (as opposed to an expense of the period). That is, the rents will be included in the manufacturing overhead which is allocated to the goods produced. (Think of the manufacturing rents as clinging to the goods produced.) As a result, the manufacturing rents will be part of the products that are in inventory and will be part of the cost of the products sold. When the items in inventory are sold, the manufacturing rent allocated to those products will be expensed as part of the cost of goods sold.",
    "Definition of Trademark": "In the U.S. a trademark could be a word, phrase, logo, etc. registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. If a company purchases a trademark from another company, the amount paid for the trademark is recorded in a general ledger intangible asset account. If a company designs and registers its trademark, the amount recorded is limited to its cost. Costs incurred to defend a trademark are also recorded in the trademark account.  The cost of a trademark may have been very small, but over time has become very valuable. (Think Apple, Coke, Nike, etc.) Due to the cost principle, the balance sheet may be reporting trademarks at close to $0.",
    "Examples of Trademarks on the Balance Sheet": "Assume that Company X, a consumer products company, introduced a new product in 2004. It registered the trademark in 2004 for a small fee that was immediately expensed. Since then Company X has been very effective in promoting this trademarked brand. Consumers now pay a premium price for this recognized and superior product. A competitor offers to purchase the trademark from Company X for $100 million in cash. If Company X does not sell the trademark, Company X will not list the trademark as an asset. (Recall that the trademark’s cost was $0.) If Company X were to sell the trademark to Company Y for $100 million, Company Y will report the trademark on its next balance sheet at $100 million. The reason is there was a transaction for $100 million and Company Y’s cost of the trademark was $100 million.",
    "Definition of LIFO": "LIFO (which is the acronym for Last In, First Out) is a cost flow assumption in which the most recent costs of inventory items are the first costs to be removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold. As a result, the older costs remain in inventory.",
    "Example of LIFO": "Assume that a corporation uses LIFO and has three units of a product in its inventory. Due to its supplier raising its prices, the corporation purchased the items at different costs and in the following sequence: $40, $44, and $46. The corporation ships the oldest item (the one purchased for $40) to a customer at a selling price of $60. However, under the LIFO cost flow assumption the company reports its cost of goods sold at $46 (the latest cost) and reports a gross profit of $14. (The costs of $40 and $44 remain in inventory.)  Had the corporation used FIFO, it would have removed $40 from inventory and matched it with the selling price of $60. The result would have been a gross profit of $20 (instead of $14 using LIFO). As a result, LIFO allowed the corporation to avoid paying income tax on the additional $6.",
    "Definition of Allowance Method": "The allowance method usually refers to one of the two ways for reporting bad debts expense that results from a company selling goods or services on credit. (The other way is the direct write-off method.) Under the allowance method, a company records an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period for the amount of the losses it anticipates as the result of extending credit to its customers. The entry will involve the operating expense account Bad Debts Expense and the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Later, when a specific account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible, the company debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable. The allowance method is preferred over the direct write-off method because:",
    "Examples of Allowance Method": "Let’s assume that a corporation begins operations on November 1 in an industry where it is common to give credit terms of net 30 days. In this industry approximately 0.3% of credit sales will not be collected. Next, let’s assume that the corporation focuses on the bad debts expense. If the corporation’s actual credit sales for November are $800,000 it will record an adjusting entry dated November 30 to debit Bad Debts Expense for $2,400 ($800,000 X 0.003) and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $2,400. As a result, its November income statement will be matching $2,400 of bad debts expense with the credit sales of $800,000. If the balance in Accounts Receivable is $800,000 as of November 30, the corporation will report Accounts Receivable (net) of $797,600. Focusing on the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, the corporation will adjust the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts so that the combination of that credit balance and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will be equal to the amount that is expected to turn to cash. The expected amount will likely be determined by aging the accounts receivable. If the corporation prepares weekly financial statements, it might focus on the bad debts expense for its weekly financial statements, but at the end of each quarter focus on the allowance account.",
    "Definition of Fully Depreciated Asset": "A fully depreciated asset is a depreciable asset for which no additional depreciation expense will be recorded. In other words, the asset’s accumulated depreciation is equal to the asset’s cost (or to its estimated salvage value).",
    "Example of Reporting a Fully Depreciated Asset on the Balance Sheet": "A fully depreciated asset that continues to be used is reported at its cost in the Property, Plant and Equipment section of the balance sheet. The asset’s accumulated depreciation continues to be included in the total accumulated depreciation amount that appears as a subtraction or negative amount in the Property, Plant and Equipment section.  The cost and accumulated depreciation will continue to be reported on the balance sheet until the asset is no longer in use. This usually occurs when the company sells or retires the asset. Fully depreciated assets and their resulting book value of zero (or its salvage value) reinforces accountants’ position that depreciation is a process for allocating an asset’s cost to expense; it is not a process for valuing the asset.",
    "Definition of Rounding Amounts on Financial Statements": "Rounding the amounts on a company’s financial statements means dropping the less important digits in order to emphasize the most important digits. This allows the financial statements to be more attractive and easier to read especially when the amounts for each of two or three years must be shown. ",
    "Example of Rounding Amounts on Financial Statements": "Imagine looking at a company’s income statement without rounded sales amounts for the most recent three years: $1,512,989.63……$1,321,026.98……$1,265,876.22. Now look at the amounts rounded to the nearest thousand: $1,513……$1,321……$1,266.\nAt the top of the financial statement you must also state “In Thousands”. Not only are the amounts easier to read, it is easier for the reader to spot a trend. Mid-size companies are likely to round the round the financial statement amounts to the nearest thousand, while large corporations are likely to round to the nearest million. Rounding is acceptable because of the accountant’s concept of materiality. That is, rounding is acceptable as long as the rounded amounts do not mislead a current or potential investor, lender, or other person making a decision with the amounts being reported.",
    "Definition of Relevance": "In accounting, the term relevance could mean one of the following:",
    "Examples of Relevance": "Assume that a company is deciding to replace equipment that has been in use for the past six years. In the decision, the original cost of the equipment and its carrying amount or book value does not have relevance (except in calculating a tax consequence). The reason is that any decision can never undo the past. The decision involves today and the future. Therefore, the relevant amounts for the decision include the cost of the new equipment and the revenues and cost savings that will result from purchasing and using the new equipment. Further, the costs that will remain the same with or without replacing the equipment are not relevant. Examples are the depreciation of the building, salaries of the company’s management, etc. For a company’s financial statements to have relevance they must be issued within several weeks after each accounting period ends. To achieve relevance, the financial statements will include some estimated amounts such as the accrual adjusting entries that are part of the accrual method of accounting.",
    "Definition of Reporting Expenses by Function": "Reporting expenses by function means to classify and report expenses according to the type of activity for which the expenses were incurred.",
    "Examples of Reporting Expenses by Function": "Manufacturers classify and report their expenses on their internal income statements by the following functions:",
    "Definition of Paying Accounts Payable": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are recorded when they have occurred, not when they are paid. Therefore, if an amount involving an expense is recorded in the current liability Accounts Payable, the expense will be recorded as part of the entry. When the company pays the invoice, the balance in Accounts Payable is reduced and the balance in the company’s Cash account is reduced. The payment does not affect the amount of expenses or net income.",
    "Example of Paying Accounts Payable": "Assume that on January 2 a company has some of its office equipment repaired. The cost of the repair is $300 and is to be paid by January 31. On January 4, the invoice for the repair is recorded with a $300 debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense–Office Equipment and a $300 credit to Accounts Payable. On January 31, the company pays the invoice and debits Accounts Payable and credits Cash for $300. The January 31 payment affected two balance sheet accounts. No expense or other income statement account was affected.",
    "Definition of Straight-Line Depreciation": "Straight-line depreciation is the most common method of allocating the cost of a plant asset to expense in the accounting periods during which the asset is used. With the straight-line method of depreciation, each full accounting year will report the same amount of depreciation. The total amount of depreciation over the years of the asset’s useful life will be the asset’s cost minus any expected or assumed salvage value. In the U.S., a regular corporation may use the straight-line method of depreciation for its financial statements while at the same time be using one of the Internal Revenue Service’s faster depreciation methods on its federal income tax return.",
    "Example of Straight-Line Depreciation": "To illustrate straight-line depreciation, assume that a service business purchases equipment on the first day of an accounting year at a cost of $430,000. Further, the equipment is expected to be used in the business for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, the company expects to receive the salvage value of $30,000. In this example, the straight-line depreciation method results in each full accounting year reporting depreciation expense of $40,000 ($400,000 of depreciable cost divided by 10 years). If the asset is purchased in the middle of the accounting year, there will be $20,000 of depreciation expense in the first and the eleventh accounting years and $40,000 in each of the accounting years 2 through 10.",
    "Definition of Bonds Payable": "Bonds payable are formal, long-term obligations that promise to pay interest every six months and the principal amount on the date the bonds mature/come due. It is common for bonds to mature 10 or more years after the date they are issued.",
    "Example of Bonds Payable Maturing within One Year of the Balance Sheet Date": "Bonds that will be maturing within one year of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current liability but only if the issuer of the bonds must use a current asset or will create a current liability in order to pay the bondholders when the bonds mature. Note that the bonds maturing within one year of the balance sheet date can continue being reported as a long-term (noncurrent) liability right up to the maturity date if one of the following situations exist:",
    "Definition of Bond Issue Costs": "The costs associated with issuing bonds are debited to a contra liability account such as Bond Issue Costs. Over the life of the bonds, the issue costs must be systematically moved from the balance sheet to the income statement. (Accountants refer to this as amortizing the costs.)",
    "Example of Bond Issue Costs": "Assume that a corporation incurs $24,000 of bond issue costs (legal and accounting fees) to register its recently issued bonds that will mature in 10 years. The corporation records these fees by debiting Bond Issue Costs for $24,000 and crediting Cash for $24,000. Using straight-line amortization, each month the corporation will debit Interest Expense for $200 ($24,000 divided by 120 months) and credit Bond Issue Costs for $200. The purpose is to match the $24,000 of bond issue costs to the 120 monthly accounting periods that are benefiting from the bonds having been issued.",
    "Definition of Income Smoothing": "Income smoothing involves reducing the fluctuations in a corporation’s earnings. The reductions in fluctuations can result from some legitimate business methods to fraudulent ones.",
    "Examples of Income Smoothing": "A corporation’s employee bonus plan, a deferred profit sharing plan, and/or a charitable giving plan may require an expense of 25% of its pretax profits. In addition, a U.S. corporation might have a combined federal and state income tax rate of 25% on its incremental pretax profits. These examples will smooth the corporation’s earnings by having larger expenses when earnings are larger, and less expenses when earnings are less. (Negative losses may even result in negative income tax expense.) In a year of low earnings, the corporation might eliminate jobs, defer maintenance projects, reduce research and development efforts, etc. Then when earnings are higher, the corporation will increase spending for personnel and get caught up on the maintenance it had put off. It is more likely that the term income smoothing is used to mean reporting misleading earnings, creative accounting, and aggressive interpretation of accounting principles and concepts. Perhaps a company increases its allowance for doubtful accounts with an increased bad debts expense only in the years with high profits. Then in a year with low profits, the company will reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts and greatly reduce bad debt expense. Perhaps a U.S. manufacturer using LIFO will deliberately reduce its inventory quantities in low profit years in order to liquidate the old LIFO layers containing low unit costs. Another manufacturer might increase its production when sales and profits are low in order for its income statement to report a lower amount of cost of goods sold. Smoothing income by abusing the leeway in accounting principles is unethical and does a disservice to the users of the financial statements. Accountants should follow the profession’s basic guidelines including:",
    "Definition of Capitalize": "In accounting, the term capitalize refers to adding an amount to the balance sheet as an asset (as opposed to immediately reporting the amount as an expense on the income statement). ",
    "Definition of Depreciate": "The term depreciate refers to systematically moving part of the cost of a plant asset from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement.",
    "Example of Capitalize and Depreciate": "Assume a corporation is self-constructing a new building next to its existing building. The corporation borrows the money for the construction from its local bank. The accounting rules state that the interest incurred for self-constructing the building should be added to the cost of the building. (The FASB refers to this as the capitalization of interest.)  Once the building is put into service, the building’s cost (including the capitalized interest) is depreciated over its useful life.",
    "Examples of Limitations of Balance Sheet": "Assume that a company developed an internet business that now attracts millions of visitors each day and has $10 million in annual revenues and $6 million in net income. Since the internet business was not purchased from another company and its cost to develop was not significant, the company’s balance sheet will report only the business’s cash, receivables and some related payables. The balance sheet will not report the business as an asset, even though the company received multiple offers to sell the internet business for $30 million. Similarly, the immensely talented designers and content writers employed at a highly profitable internet marketing firm are not reported as assets on the firm’s balance sheet because of the cost principle. This is also true for the firm’s brand names that resulted from effective marketing, highly satisfied service, and expertise in specialty services that are in great demand. Another limitation of the balance sheet involves a company’s land and buildings in valuable locations that were acquired many years ago. For instance, the company’s land is reported at an amount no greater than its cost. The company’s buildings are reported at their cost minus the accumulated depreciation. As a result, the amounts reported on the company’s balance sheet for its land and buildings are significantly lower than their current market values.",
    "Definition of Commitments and Contingencies": "Commitments and contingencies is a balance sheet line with no amount reported. The line generally appears between the liabilities and stockholders’ equity sections to direct a reader’s attention to the disclosures included in the notes to the financial statements. Commitments are likely legal binding agreements for future transactions. If no amount is currently payable, there is no liability amount reported but readers must be informed of items that are significant in amount. Contingencies refer to potential or contingent liabilities and losses. These are reported in the notes to the financial statements (instead of a general ledger account) because the amount might not be determinable or the liability is possible but not probable. Generally, gain contingencies are not disclosed.",
    "Examples of Commitments and Contingencies": "A chain of retail stores may have signed five-year, noncancelable leases to rent retail space for $1 million per year. This significant commitment must be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if the $5 million pertains to future dates, there is no liability amount to be reported on the current balance sheet. Another example of a commitment is an electric utility’s noncancelable contract to purchase 100 million tons of coal during the following 10 years. This significant commitment must also be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if none of the coal has been delivered as of the balance sheet date, the utility company will not report a liability amount. Companies will often have some contingent liabilities, which are not recorded in the general ledger because the liability and loss may or may not become a liability. Unless the liability/loss is remote, if the item is signicant, it must be disclosed. An example of a contingent liability is a company’s guarantee of its key supplier’s bank loan. No liability amount is reported on the company’s balance sheet because the supplier’s loan payments are current and the supplier is operating profitably. If the company is named in a lawsuit, but the loss and liability is possible, it should be disclosed in the company’s notes to the financial statements. (If the loss is remote, it does not get disclosed. If the loss is probable and the amount can be estimated, it should be recorded in the accounts and the amount of the liability reported on the balance sheet.) ",
    "Definition of Double-Declining-Balance Depreciation": "The double-declining-balance method of depreciation is a form of accelerated depreciation. This means a greater percentage of depreciable asset’s cost will be expensed in early years of the asset’s life and therefore less in the later years (compared to equal amounts using straight-line depreciation).",
    "Use of Double-Declining-Balance on Financial Statements": "Generally, companies will not use the double-declining-balance method of depreciation on their financial statements. The reason is that it causes the company’s net income in the early years of an asset’s life to be lower than it would be under the straight-line method. One reason for using  double-declining-balance depreciation on the financial statements is to have a more consistent combination of depreciation expense and repairs and maintenance expense throughout the life of the asset. In other words, in the early years of the asset’s life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are low, the depreciation expense will be high. In the later years of the asset’s life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are high, the depreciation expense will be low. (While this seems logical, companies prefer to delay expenses and enjoy the higher net income in the early years of an asset’s life.)",
    "Definition of Note Payable and Bond Payable": "For accounting purposes, a note payable and a bond payable have the following similarities:",
    "Example of Note Payable and Bond Payable": "Assume that a corporation recently borrowed $200,000 in the form of a note payable due in two years with interest of 8% per year paid quarterly. In addition, it recently issued a $2,000,000 6% bond payable due in 10 years with interest paid semiannually. Both the note payable and the bond payable are to be reported as long-term (noncurrent) liabilities on the corporation’s balance sheet. Any interest that has accrued but was not paid as of the balance sheet date is to be reported as a current liability such as Accrued Expenses Payable. On the corporation’s income statements, the interest that occurred (whether paid or not paid) during the period of the income statement will be reported as interest expense.",
    "Definition of Rotating Inventory Stock": "To rotate stock means to arrange the oldest units in inventory so they are sold before the newer units. The goal is to avoid losses due to getting close to (or past) the sell by dates, deterioration, obsolescence, etc.  Expressed another way, to rotate the stock of goods on hand means that the physical flow of goods will result in the first or oldest goods being sold first. However, the accounting cost flows do not have to agree with the physical flow of the goods. This means that a U.S. business can diligently rotate its inventory items, and at the same time use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost flow assumption. (In periods of inflation LIFO means the higher/recent costs will be  moved to the cost of goods sold while the older/lower costs remain in inventory. This can result in less taxable income and less income taxes.)",
    "Example of Rotating Inventory Stock": "A grocery store restocks its shelves by moving the oldest units to the front of the shelves and places the newest units in the back of the shelves. The hope is that the customer will select the most convenient (older) units from the front of the shelf. In order for a company to avoid losses, it is important that the stock of goods in all locations (retail display area, warehouses, factory, etc.) be rotated. When the grocery store rotates its stock, the units are physically flowing first-in, first-out (FIFO). However, in the accounting for the cost of inventory and the cost of the goods sold, a U.S. company is allowed to use a cost flow assumption which is different from the flow of the physical units.",
    "Definition of Interest Expense as a Nonoperating Expense": "Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money. For most companies the borrowing of money is not part of their main business activities. Most companies purchase or produce goods and sell them, or they provide services to clients, etc. The borrowing and lending of money is just an incidental or peripheral activity. Therefore, their interest expense is reported as a nonoperating expense on their income statements.",
    "Example of Interest Expense as a Nonoperating Expense": "Assume that prior to its holiday season, a retailer borrows $200,000 from its bank and promises to repay the bank in three months plus interest of $3,000. On each of the retailer’s monthly income statements, it will report $1,000 of interest expense in the “nonoperating” or “other” section, which appears after the amount of operating income is shown. As a result, the income statement allows for an easy comparison of the operations and profitability of companies regardless of their debt and interest expense.",
    "Definition of Income Taxes Paid by a Corporation": "The amount of income tax paid by a corporation is different from the amount of income tax (income tax provision, income tax expense) that is reported on a regular corporation’s income statement. US GAAP requires corporations to report/disclose the amount of income taxes paid (as well as the amount of interest paid).  ",
    "Example of Where the Income Taxes Paid is Reported": "The amount of income taxes paid by a corporation is typically shown at the bottom of the statement of cash flows or in the corporation’s notes to the financial statements. For U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly-traded, you will find the statement of cash flows included in its Form 10-K, which is the annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",
    "Definition of Asset’s Useful Life": "An asset’s useful life is the estimated period of time (or total amount of activity) that a long-lived asset will be economically feasible for use in a business. In other words, it is the expected number of years that the business asset will be in service for earning revenues. With technological advances, an asset’s useful life will likely be shorter than its physical life.",
    "Example of an Asset’s Useful Life": "Assume that a high tech company’s cell phones are expected to have a useful life of three years (even though the physical life of the cell phones could be 10 years). Also assume that the company has purchased 100 smart phones at a total cost of $120,000. The company also estimates that the phones will have no salvage value at the end of the useful life. The company’s straight-line depreciation will be $40,000 ($120,000 / 3 years). This allocation of the phones’ cost to the accounting periods that benefit from the asset’s use follows the accountant’s matching principle. This makes the company’s financial statements more realistic and in compliance with the accrual basis of accounting. Note: In the U.S., income tax regulations specify the useful life that must be used for income tax reporting. This is one reason that in a given year the depreciation on a company’s income tax return will not agree with the depreciation reported on its financial statements.",
    "Definition of Depletion": "In accounting, depletion refers to the expensing of a company’s cost of a natural resource. Ultimately, it means moving a natural resource’s cost from the company’s balance sheet to the company’s income statements as the natural resource is being sold. The objective of depletion is to match the cost of the natural resources that were sold with the revenues  from the natural resources that were sold.  Conceptually, depletion is similar to the depreciation of property, plant and equipment.",
    "Examples of Depletion": "Examples of depletion involve the logical expensing of a company’s cost of natural resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, metals, stone, etc.",
    "Definition of Time Value of Money": "The time value of money recognizes that receiving cash today is more valuable than receiving cash in the future. The reason is that the cash received today can be invested immediately and begin growing in value. For instance, if a company receives $1,000 today and is able to invest the amount immediately at a rate of 10% per year, the company will have $1,100 after 365 days. If the time value of money is 10%, it also means that receiving $1,100 in one year is comparable to receiving $1,000 today. Accountants will state that the future value of $1,100 has a present value of $1,000. The difference of $100 will be reported as interest income during the 365 days that the company is earning the interest.",
    "Example of the Time Value of Money": "Assume that a company provides consulting services today and agrees to receive $11,000 one year later. The $11,000 represents:",
    "Importance of the Time Value of Money in Accounting": "The time value of money is important in accounting because of the accountant’s cost principle and revenue recognition principle. However, the concepts of materiality and cost/benefit allow the accountants to ignore the time value of money for the routine accounts receivable and accounts payable having credit terms of 30 or 60 days.",
    "Definition of Events After Balance Sheet Date": "Events after the balance sheet date are significant financial events that occur after the date of the balance sheet but prior to the date that the financial statements are issued. For instance, between a company’s balance sheet date of December 31, 2023 and the time that the  financial statements are distributed on January 31, 2024, it is possible a significant event occurs or information becomes known that is important to the users of the December 31 financial statements. The following are two types of events/information that require the accountant’s consideration:",
    "Example of Events After Balance Sheet Date": "To illustrate the first situation, assume a customer owes a corporation $200,000 on December 31 and the corporation believed that the customer’s receivable would be collected in full. (Therefore, the corporation did not have any allowance for doubtful accounts.) On January 28 the corporation learns that the customer filed for bankruptcy and none of the customer’s balance of $200,000 will be collected. If the customer’s financial condition on December 31 was already in bankruptcy condition, the corporation must adjust its December 31 balance sheet by reducing its net receivables by $200,000 and reporting bad debts expense of $200,000 on its income statement for the year 2023. An example of the second situation is a loss arising from a catastrophe occurring on January 16, 2024. The amounts reported as of December 31, 2023 will not be adjusted since those amounts were correct as of December 31. However, the readers of the December 31, 2023 financial statements should be informed through a disclosure that a significant loss had occurred to the company’s financial position since December 31.",
    "Definition of Standard Costing": "Standard costing  is a cost accounting system used by some manufacturers to assist in planning and controlling its manufacturing operations. When standard costing is used, the manufacturer’s general ledger accounts for inventories (materials, work-in-process, finished goods) and the cost of goods sold will contain the standard costs. (Think of the standard costs as the “should be” costs which are tied to the amounts in the company’s profit plan.) Any differences between the actual costs and the standard costs will be recorded in cost variance  accounts. For external financial reporting, the variances must be allocated to the inventories and the cost of goods sold.",
    "Example of Standard Costing and GAAP": "Assume that a corporation’s profit plan for the year uses $2 as the cost for every pound for its main raw material. Therefore, its standard costing system uses $2 per pound. Due to shortages, the corporation’s actual cost for the 1,000,000 pounds of materials it purchased was $2.60 per pound. This means the general ledger accounts for its inventories and cost of goods sold contain $2 per pound for the materials and its materials purchase price variance account contains an unfavorable variance of $600,000 [1,000,000 X ($2.60 – $2.00)]. To comply with GAAP’s cost principle, the corporation must allocate the $600,000 to the inventories and cost of goods sold when reporting its financial results. (If the corporation turned over its inventory many times during the year, most of the variance will be allocated to the cost of goods sold, since that is where most of the materials are.)",
    "Definition of Effect of LIFO Instead of FIFO": "During periods of significantly increasing costs, the LIFO cost flow assumption instead of the FIFO cost flow assumption will have the following effect:",
    "Examples of Effect on Financial Ratios from LIFO Instead of FIFO": "When there is significantly increasing costs, the following profitability ratios will be smaller under LIFO than FIFO:",
    "Definition of Lien": "A lien is a legal document filed by a creditor (lender) in order to record its claim on certain assets of the debtor (borrower). The lien is likely filed at the county government office where the debtor’s property is located. The lien protects the creditor until the debtor pays the amount owed. A lien on a company’s assets should be disclosed in the company’s notes to the financial statements.",
    "Examples of Liens": "The following are examples of liens:",
    "Definition of Manufacturing Overhead Allocated to Products": "Manufacturing overhead refers to the indirect production costs of producing goods, products, component parts, etc. The manufacturing overhead costs are also known as factory overhead costs, burden, indirect manufacturing costs, and indirect product costs. Since manufacturing overhead is an indirect product cost, it needs to be allocated or assigned to the products manufactured and will cling to the products. Hence, the manufacturing overhead costs (along with the cost of the direct materials and direct labor) will be part of the cost of the items in inventory and the cost of the items sold. Accountants refer to this as full absorption costing. Accountants will also say that the manufactured goods must absorb both the variable and fixed manufacturing overhead costs.",
    "Example of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts": "Assume a company has $230,000 of accounts receivable at the end of its accounting year. Its Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (before any further adjustment) has a credit balance of $10,000. At this point, the company’s balance sheet will report that the company will collect the net amount of $220,000. However, the credit manager’s recent review indicates that the company will not be collecting a total of $25,000 of the accounts receivable. Based on the new information, the accountant should write an adjusting entry that debits Bad Debts Expense for $15,000 and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $15,000. After this adjusting entry is made: 1) the balance sheet will report the correct net amount of $205,000 ($230,000 – $25,000) not the overstated, incorrect amount of $220,000, and 2) the income statement will report the correct amount of net income, which is $15,000 less than the original, incorrect amount of net income. ",
    "Definition of Arms Length Transaction": "An arms length transaction exists when two independent (unrelated) parties are each attempting to get the best deal possible.",
    "Example of Arms Length Transaction": "Assume a company builds single-family residences. An unrelated customer asks the company to inform them of the price for constructing a specific residence. The company prepares a detailed calculation of the final price that the customer will pay. The price will include the cost of all of the materials, labor, overhead, a cushion for the unexpected, and the company’s required profit. Assume that the final amount is $240,000. The customer wants the house, but believes there is a little “wiggle room” in the $240,000. The company and the customer go back and forth and finally they agree on a price of $239,000. Since both parties were attempting to get the best price, the transaction is viewed as an arms length transaction. The resulting price should be close to the fair market price. On the other hand, if the daughter of the company’s owner wants the company to build her the same house as the person above, the company may inform the daughter that the house will cost $225,000. Since the customer (the daughter) and the company are related parties, the transaction is not an arms length transaction. As a result, the daughter is able to get the house for less than the fair market price.",
    "Definition of Deferred Asset": "A deferred asset represents costs that have occurred, but because of certain circumstances the costs will be reported as expenses at a later time. You might consider a deferred asset to be a prepaid expense that does not qualify to be reported as a current asset.  A deferred asset might also be referred to as a deferred charge.",
    "Example of a Deferred Asset": "Assume that an electric utility spent $300,000 for a project before it had to be abandoned. The state regulators ruled that the utility may recover the $300,000 from its customers in the form of higher electricity rates over a 5-year period starting next year. Because of this assurance, the utility will record the $300,000 as a deferred asset. In each of the five subsequent years, the utility will credit the deferred asset account for $60,000 and will debit an expense for $60,000. Hence, the utility’s $60,000 of increased expenses will be matched with the $60,000 of increased electricity revenues it will be reporting on its five annual income statements.",
    "Definition of Inventory Methods": "Inventory methods refers to the order or manner in which a company moves its actual costs out of the current asset inventory and to the cost of goods sold, which is reported on its income statement. Since the costs of products may be higher when they are reordered/purchased, the order in which their costs are removed from inventory will have an impact on the inventory valuation and the amount reported as the cost of goods sold (and therefore the gross profit, operating income, net income). The order in which the costs are removed from inventory is referred to as the cost flow assumption. It is important to understand that the cost flow does not have to agree with the order in which the goods are physically removed from inventory.",
    "Examples of Inventory Methods": "The following are only a few of the many cost flow assumptions used for valuing inventory:",
    "Where to Find a Corporation’s Inventory Methods": "The inventory methods and cost flow assumptions used by a corporation (with shares of common stock that are publicly traded) can be found in the corporation’s Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K. The Summary is likely the first or second item in the Notes to the Financial Statements. Most publicly traded corporations have an Investors Relations link on their website’s home page. On the Investors Relations page you will find a link to the corporation’s annual SEC filings.",
    "Definition of Present Value": "In accounting, present value refers to the amount after discounting future cash amounts to the present. The present is depicted on a timeline as the point 0, which is the beginning of period 1. The discounting process involves removing the time value of money or future interest which is contained (is implicit) within the future cash amounts. Accountants record the present value of a future amount when the cash amount, cash equivalent amount, or fair market value at the time of the transaction is not known.",
    "Example of Present Value": "Assume Website Services Corp (WSC) completed extensive and unique services for a client and agreed to a single payment of $100,000 to be made two years from now. The client’s financial condition would require it to pay interest of 20% in order to borrow the money from a lender. WSC does not know the cash value of the unique services it provided nor does it know the market value. As a result, WSC discounts the future $100,000 by using the interest rate of 20% for two years to arrive at the present value of $69,400. WSC will record current revenues of $69,400 and a net receivable of $69,400 (Receivable of $100,000 minus Discount on Receivable of $30,600). As WSC earns the $30,600 of interest over the next two years, it will credit Interest Income and debit Discount on Receivable.",
    "Definition of a Retailer’s Product Cost": "In accounting, a retailer’s product cost is the cost paid to a supplier plus any other costs that are necessary to get the product in place and ready for sale. For example, if a retailer pays $40 to its supplier and then pays $10 to get it delivered to its warehouse, the retailer’s product cost is $50. ",
    "Definition of a Manufacturer’s Product Cost": "A manufacturer’s product cost includes the cost of each product’s raw materials plus the costs of converting the raw materials into products. The manufacturer’s product costs are usually classified into three groups:",
    "Product Costs Are Used for Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold": "Both the product costs of a retailer and the product costs of a manufacturer are also referred to as inventoriable costs, since the product costs are used to value their goods in inventory. When the goods are sold, the product costs will be removed from inventory and will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.",
    "SG&A Not Included in Product Costs": "The selling, general, administrative (SG&A) and interest costs of a retailer and/or a manufacturer are not product costs. Rather, they are reported as expenses on the income statement of the accounting period in which they were incurred.",
    "Definition of FIFO and LIFO": "FIFO and LIFO pertain to the flow of products’ costs out of inventory to the cost of goods sold  that is reported on the income statement. First, if the costs of the inventory items never change, there will be no difference whether FIFO or LIFO is used. The reason is that the first costs (oldest costs) will be the same as the latest or recent costs. On the other hand, if the costs of the inventory items are increasing often and significantly, the differences in profits and inventory values between FIFO and LIFO will be significant.",
    "Example of LIFO with Increasing Costs": "In the U.S., LIFO is considered to be better when the costs of inventory items are changing. The reason is LIFO is matching the latest costs of products with the recent sales revenues. In addition, the U.S. tax rules also allow for either FIFO or LIFO, but require the same cost flow assumption be used on both the company’s tax return and on the company’s financial statements. With inflation being the norm, profitable companies using LIFO are matching the higher recent costs with the recent revenues and will be reporting lower taxable income and remitting smaller income tax payments.",
    "Definition of Capital Budgeting Decisions": "Capital budgeting assists in the investment decisions regarding assets that will have an impact on  more than one year. Some capital budgeting models use cash flows that are discounted for the time value of money. The time value of money recognizes that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar received in the future. Other capital budgeting models use cash flows without discounting them, while others use the accrual accounting revenues and expenses and also ignore the time value of money. Since the investments have an impact over many years, the preferred methods for capital budgeting decisions are those which use discounted cash flows. (In addition to using the discounted cash flow models, a company is likely to also calculate some non-discounted accrual accounting amounts to see how the investments will impact its future What is a financial statement?”>financial statements.)",
    "Examples of Capital Budgeting Models": "The following are capital budgeting models that use cash flows which are then discounted to recognize the time value of money: ",
    "Definition of Purchase Discounts Lost": "The account Purchase Discounts Lost is a general ledger account used by a company that records vendors’ invoices using the net method. A debit amount is entered in Purchase Discounts Lost only if a company fails to pay a vendor’s invoice within the vendor’s early payment discount period. Purchase Discounts Lost is considered to be an interest expense or a financing charge resulting from the buyer not being able to pay the cash price. (Recall that in accounting cost is defined as the cash amount or the cash equivalent amount.)",
    "Example of Purchase Discounts Lost": "Assume that a retailer’s policy is to always pay a vendor’s legitimate invoice within the early payment discount period if such a discount is offered. Also assume that the retailer received a vendor’s invoice for $1,000 which has payment terms of 2/10, net 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the retailer will enter the invoice in its accounting records with a debit of $980 ($1,000 minus 2% discount) to Purchases or Inventory and a credit of $980 to Accounts Payable. If the retailer pays the vendor’s invoice within the 10-day early payment discount period, the retailer will record the payment with a debit of $980 to Accounts Payable and a credit of $980 to Cash. However, if the retailer fails to pay the invoice within the early payment discount period, the retailer is required to remit $1,000. In that case the retailer will credit Cash for $1,000; debit Accounts Payable for $980; and debit Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Note that the cost of the goods purchased remains at $980 (the cash price).",
    "Definition of Form 10-K": "Form 10-K is a required annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by U.S. corporations whose common stock is publicly traded. It is common for a corporation’s Form 10-K to contain 100 pages of information much of which is presented under the following headings:",
    "Example of Form 10-K": "You can review a Form 10-K by doing an online search for a corporation with publicly-traded shares of common stock. On the corporation’s website, select Investor Relations, and from that page select Annual Reports or Reports to SEC. ",
    "Definition of External Financial Statements": "External financial statements are those distributed outside of the company’s management. Some of the recipients of the external financial statements include the following:",
    "Examples of External Financial Statements": "The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation consist of a complete set of the following:",
    "Definition of Gains": "In financial accounting, gains often pertain to some of a company’s transactions which occur outside of the company’s main business activities. Transactions which are outside of a company’s main business activities are referred to as nonoperating activities. ",
    "Gain vs Operating Income": "Let’s assume that a company is a retailer whose main business activities are the purchasing and reselling of merchandise. When the retailer sells $5,000 of merchandise that it had purchased at a cost of $3,000, the retailer’s income statement will report sales of merchandise of $5,000 and cost of goods sold of $3,000. The difference of $2,000 is part of the retailer’s gross profit, operating income, and net income. The word “gain” is not appropriate since the activities involved the normal business activities of the retailer. However, if the same retailer sells its old delivery van, this transaction is outside of the retailer’s main business activities of purchasing and selling merchandise. Therefore, the sale of the van will not be included with the sales of merchandise. Instead, a gain (or loss) will be reported as one of the company’s nonoperating items often under the heading of other income.",
    "Calculating a Gain": "To illustrate the calculation of a gain, let’s assume that the retailer sells its old van for $5,000 cash. At the time of the sale the van is on the retailer’s books at $3,500 (which consists of its original cost of $20,000 and accumulated depreciation of $16,500). Since this transaction is not a main business activity of the retailer and since the $5,000 of cash received is greater than the net cost of $3,500 being removed from the accounts, the retailer will report a nonoperating item described as gain on sale of van of $1,500. ",
    "More Examples of Gains": "Other examples of gains that could appear on a company’s income statement include:",
    "Definition of Obsolete Inventory": "Obsolete inventory refers to products that a company had purchased or produced which cannot be sold. The obsolete items may be the result of one or more of the following:",
    "Consequences of Obsolete Inventory": "When inventory items become obsolete, the reality is that their value is significantly lower than their cost. As a result, the U.S. accounting rules require that the cost of the obsolete inventory items be reduced to their net realizable value. Failure to reduce their cost will mean that the following amounts on the company’s financial statements will be overstated:",
    "Benefits of Disposing of Obsolete Inventory": "Since the value of the obsolete items may continue to decrease, it is wise to dispose of the items at any price as soon as possible. The benefits of disposing of the obsolete items will result in the company:",
    "Definition of Opportunity Cost": "Opportunity cost is the profit that was lost or missed because of some action or failure to take some action. Some refer to opportunity cost as  opportunity lost.",
    "Example of Opportunity Costs": "Assume that you want to add a website to your already successful business. You are confident that it will increase your company’s contribution margin by $1,500 a week. A highly-trusted and successful firm will complete the website within 4 weeks at a set price of $10,000. A friend offered to develop your website for $6,500 but it will take 7 weeks. Based on the out-of-pocket cost, your friend’s bid looks better because of the $3,500 saved ($6,500 instead of $10,000). However, with your friend’s work you will have lost the opportunity to earn an additional $4,500 (3 weeks at $1,500 a week). Therefore, the cost of you friend’s work is $11,000 (the out-of-pocket cost of $6,500 + the opportunity cost of $4,500). The highly-trusted firm’s cost of $10,000 now looks like the better option. Interestingly, the opportunity costs are not found or recorded in the general ledger accounts. Hence, if you selected your friend’s offer, only the $6,500 paid to your friend will be recorded as the cost of the website. (The 3 weeks of missed profits are not recorded and will not be widely discussed.) This is also a reminder that the general ledger accounts are filled with past, historical amounts. Unfortunately, the relevant costs for decision making are the future costs and the opportunity costs (neither of which are not in the general ledger and are probably unknown at the time a decision must be made).",
    "Definition of Calendar Year": "A calendar year is the 12 consecutive months from January through December. In other words, it is the 365 days (366 days in a leap year) beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31.",
    "Example of Calendar Years": "In the U.S., individuals file their personal income tax returns based on the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. Many U.S. corporations also have accounting and income tax years that coincide with the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. However, U.S. corporations may have an accounting year and income tax year that is not a calendar year. ",
    "Examples of Non-calendar Years": "If a U.S. corporation has a non-calendar accounting year, it is referred to as a fiscal year. For example, a U.S. corporation can have a fiscal year that begins on October 1 and ends on the following September 30. Educational institutions often have fiscal years that begin on July 1 and end on the following June 30. A U.S. retailer can have a fiscal year consisting of 52 weeks that begins on the Sunday closest to February 1 and ends on the Saturday closest to February 1 of the following year.",
    "Definition of Accounting": "Accounting is the recording of financial transactions along with storing, sorting, retrieving, summarizing, and presenting the results in various reports and analyses. Accounting is also a field of study and profession dedicated to carrying out those tasks.",
    "Examples of Financial Accounting": "One part of accounting focuses on presenting the financial information in the form of general-purpose financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, etc.) that are distributed to people outside of the company. These external reports must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles often referred to as GAAP or US GAAP.",
    "Examples of Management Accounting": "Another part of accounting focuses on providing a company’s management with the information needed to keep the business financially healthy. Although some of the information comes from recorded transactions, many of the analyses and reports include estimated and projected amounts based on various assumptions. Generally, this information is not distributed to people outside of the company’s management. A few examples of this information are budgets, standards for controlling operations, and estimating selling prices when quoting prices for new work.",
    "Other Examples of Accounting": "Some of the many other examples of accounting include:",
    "Definition of Dividends": "It is important to note that the dividends declared and paid by a corporation are not an expense of the corporation. Rather, dividends are a distribution of the corporation’s earnings. This explains why state laws likely require corporations to have a credit balance in Retained Earnings before declaring and paying dividends. Practically speaking, the corporation must also have sufficient cash available to meet its current and future needs. While all corporations have common stock, some corporations will also have preferred stock. In that situation the preferred stockholders must receive their dividend before the common stockholders.",
    "Financial Statements of a Corporation": "The main financial statements of a corporation are:",
    "Where Dividends Appear on the Financial Statements": "The dividends declared and paid by a corporation in the most recent year will be reported on these financial statements for the recent year:",
    "Definition of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio": "The accounts receivable turnover ratio (or receivables turnover ratio) is an important financial ratio that indicates a company’s ability to collect its accounts receivable. Collecting accounts receivable is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due. The calculation of the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales for a year divided by the company’s average amount of accounts receivable throughout that year. Note that only the company’s credit sales (or sales on credit) are used in the calculation, since cash sales do not involve accounts receivable.",
    "Example of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio": "To illustrate the calculation of the accounts receivable turnover, let’s assume that a company’s credit sales for the most recent year were $6,000,000 and its average amount of accounts receivable during that year were $600,000. As a result, the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales of $6,000,000 divided by the average amount of accounts receivable of $600,000 = 10 times a year. This indicates that on average the company’s accounts receivables turned over 10 times during the year, or approximately every 36 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 10). Whether the accounts receivable turnover ratio of 10 is good or bad depends on the company’s past ratios, the average for other companies in the same industry, and the specific credit terms given to the company’s customers.",
    "Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is an Average": "Since the accounts receivable turnover ratio is an average, it can be hiding some important details. For example, past due receivables could be hidden/offset by receivables that have paid faster than the average. Therefore, if you have access to the company’s details, you should review a detailed aging of accounts receivable to discover any past due accounts.",
    "Definition of Current Ratio": "The current ratio is the proportion, quotient, or relationship between the amount of a company’s current assets and the amount of its current liabilities. The current ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of current assets by the amount of current liabilities.",
    "Example of Current Ratio": "If a company’s current assets are $600,000 and its current liabilities are $200,000 the current ratio is 3:1. If the current assets are $600,000 and the current liabilities are $500,000 the current ratio is 1.2:1. Obviously a larger current ratio is better than a smaller ratio. Some people feel that a current ratio that is less than 1:1 indicates insolvency. However, some online sellers with customers paying with credit cards at the time of ordering may operate comfortably with a very low current ratio.  It is wise to compare a company’s current ratio to that of other companies in the same industry. You are also wise to compare a company’s recent current ratio to its ratio at earlier dates. In other words, spotting a trend can be important. Caution\nThe composition of the current assets is also an important consideration. If the current assets are predominantly in cash, marketable securities, and collectible accounts receivable, that is likely to provide more liquidity than a huge amount of slow moving inventory.",
    "Definition of Cash from Operating Activities": "Cash from operating activities usually refers to the first section of the statement of cash flows. Cash from operating activities focuses on the cash inflows and outflows from a company’s main business activities of buying and selling merchandise, providing services, etc. Basically, the cash from operating activities includes the company’s cash flows except for those reported as cash flows from 1) investing activities (buying and selling property, plant and equipment, buying and selling long-term investments), and 2) financing activities (borrowing and repaying short-term and long-term debt, issuing and buying back shares of stock, paying dividends).",
    "Examples of Reporting the Cash from Operating Activities": "In the U.S., the cash from operating activities can be presented using either of the following methods:",
    "Definition of Financial Reporting": "Financial reporting includes all of a company’s communication of financial information to people outside of the company. ",
    "Examples of Financial Reporting": "Financial reporting includes the following:",
    "Definition of Liquidity Ratio": "A liquidity ratio is a financial ratio that indicates whether a company’s current assets will be sufficient to meet the company’s obligations when they become due.",
    "Examples of Liquidity Ratios": "Typically, the following financial ratios are considered to be liquidity ratios:",
    "Effect of Revenue on the Balance Sheet": "Generally, when a corporation earns revenue there is an increase in current assets (cash or accounts receivable) and an increase in the retained earnings component of stockholders’ equity . When a company earns revenue that had been prepaid by a customer, the company’s balance sheet’s liability deferred revenue will decrease and retained earnings will increase. ",
    "Examples of the Effect of Revenue on the Balance Sheet": "Examples of revenue include the sales of merchandise, service fee revenue, subscription revenue, advertising revenue, interest revenue, etc. The revenue accounts are temporary accounts that facilitate the preparation of the income statement. However, when a corporation earns revenue, it has the effect of increasing Retained Earnings. We can see this with the end-of-the-year closing entries which will move all the income statement account balances to Retained Earnings. Let’s assume that today a corporation sold goods on credit. The corporation’s current asset Accounts Receivable will increase and the company will credit the income statement account Sales. However, the Sales account is a temporary account that has the effect of increasing the corporation’s retained earnings. Let’s assume that on December 31 a corporation received $10,000 for services to be done in January. Therefore, the corporation’s cash that is reported on the December 31 balance sheet includes the $10,000 and the balance sheet will also report a current liability deferred revenues of $10,000. In January, when the services have been provided, the corporation will record Service Fee Revenue of $10,000 (which has the effect of increasing the corporation’s retained earnings) and will eliminate the current liability of $10,000 that appeared on the December 31 balance sheet.",
    "Definition of Compilation": "A compilation refers to a company’s financial statements that have been prepared or compiled by an outside accountant.  A compilation is usually part of an accounting firm’s write-up service. With compilations, or compiled financial statements, the outside accountant converts the client’s data into financial statements without providing any assurances or auditing services. A compilation report should accompany the compiled financial statements to indicate that the financial statements 1) are the representation of the company’s management, and 2) have not been reviewed or audited and therefore the accountant does not offer an opinion or any assurances on the financial statements. Compilations allow companies without an accountant to have financial statements prepared by an outside professional without the higher cost of reviewed or audited financial statements.",
    "Example of a Compilation": "A company prepares its own monthly financial statements by using popular accounting software. However, as part of the company’s loan agreement with its bank, the company must provide the bank with annual financial statements that have been compiled by a certified public accountant. (The bank does not require the borrower to incur the expense of a CPA’s review or audit.) ",
    "Definition of Statement of Comprehensive Income": "The statement of comprehensive income is one of the five financial statements required in a complete set of financial statements for distribution outside of a corporation. The statement of comprehensive income covers the same period of time as the income statement and consists of two major sections:",
    "Definition of Consolidated Financial Statements": "Consolidated financial statements are financial statements for a group of separate legal entities that are controlled by one company (the parent company). The consolidated financial statements report the financial results of the entire group’s transactions with people and companies outside of the group. Most of the financial statements of large corporations with shares of stock trading on a stock exchanges appear to be consolidated financial statements.",
    "Example of Consolidated Financial Statements": "Assume NEP is an electric utility with its common stock trading on a stock exchange. NEP acquires all of the stock of Midwest Gas Corporation (MGC). Both NEP and MGC continue as separate legal entities. NEP is the parent company and MGC is a subsidiary company. Each of these corporations continue to operate its respective business and each will issue its own financial statements. However, the investors and potential investors in NEP will find it helpful to see the results of operations and the financial position of the group of companies (also referred to as the economic entity) consisting of the combination of NEP and MGC. The consolidated income statement of NEP will report all of the revenues that the group of companies earned from outside customers. (Since the sales of electricity from NEP to MGC and the sales of gas from MGC to NEP are not earned outside of the group of companies, those sales are eliminated when NEP’s and MGC’s income statements are combined to become the consolidated income statement.) The consolidated income statement will also report all the expenses that were incurred outside of the group of companies. (Since the purchases of electricity by MGC from NEP and the purchases of gas by NEP from MGC did not occur outside of the group of companies, these purchases are also eliminated.) The consolidated balance sheet of NEP will report all of the cash, receivables, plant, etc. of the group of companies (the economic entity). It will also report all of the liabilities of the economic entity. (The amounts payable and receivable between NEP and MGC are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet.) This is a very brief overview of consolidated financial statements. “Consolidations” is a major topic within the university course and textbook entitled Advanced Accounting.",
    "Definition of Debt to Equity Ratio": "The debt to equity ratio or debt-equity ratio is the result of dividing a corporation’s total liabilities by the total amount of stockholders’ equity. Expressed as a formula, the debt to equity ratio is: (Liabilities/Stockholders’ Equity):1. Generally, the higher the ratio of debt to equity, the greater is the risk for the corporation’s creditors and prospective creditors.",
    "Example of Debt to Equity Ratio": "A corporation with $1,200,000 of liabilities and $2,000,000 of stockholders’ equity will have a debt to equity ratio of 0.6:1. A corporation with total liabilities of $1,200,000 and stockholders’ equity of $400,000 will have a debt to equity ratio of 3:1.",
    "Definition of Rolling Budget": "A rolling budget often refers to a company’s operating budget which presents the future monthly budgets for the next 12 months. A rolling budget is also known as a continuous budget, perpetual budget, or rolling horizon budget.",
    "Examples of a Rolling Budget": "Assume that a company’s accounting year ends on each December 31. Prior to the start of the year 2024, the company prepares its annual budget which is detailed by month for January through December 2024. This budget could become a rolling budget if after January 2024 the company drops the budget for January 2024 and adds the budget for January 2025. This rolling budget now covers the 12 months from February 1, 2024 through January 31, 2025. At the end of February 2024, the rolling budget will drop February 2024 and will add February 2025. At this point the rolling budget will cover the 12 months of March 2024 through February 2025. The benefit of a rolling budget is that the company’s management will always have a budget that looks forward for one full year. A rolling budget could use 3-month periods or quarters instead of months. In addition, a company may have a 5-year rolling budget for capital expenditures. In this case a full year will be added to replace the year that has just ended. This 5-year rolling budget means that management will always have a forward looking 5-year capital expenditures plan.",
    "Definition of Profit Margin Ratio": "The after tax profit margin ratio expresses the company’s net income or earnings as a percent of the company’s net sales. In other words, the after tax profit margin ratio shows the percentage that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold and all other expenses including income tax expense. The calculation is: Net Income after Tax divided by Net Sales. The profit margin ratio is most useful when it is compared to 1) the company’s profit margin ratios from its earlier accounting periods, 2) the company’s targeted or planned profit margin ratio for the current accounting period, and 3) the profit margin ratios of other companies in the same industry during the same accounting period.",
    "Example of Profit Margin Ratio": "Assume that a retailer had the following results in its most recent year:",
    "Definition of the Statement of Stockholders’ Equity": "The statement of stockholders’ equity (also known as the statement of shareholders’ equity, statement of equity, statement of changes in stockholders’ equity, statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, and statement of changes in equity) is one of the five required financial statements issued by a U.S. corporation whose common stock is publicly traded. This financial statement summarizes on one page all of the changes that occurred in the stockholders’ equity accounts during the accounting year.",
    "Examples of the Columns Often Appearing on the Statement": "The statement usually has the following columns into which the amounts will be sorted:",
    "Examples of the Descriptions for the Rows or Lines Appearing on the Statement": "Some typical descriptions for the amounts being reported include:",
    "Differences Between the Direct Method and Indirect Method": "For a summary of the differences in the two methods for preparing the statement of cash flows, please click the following: Differences between the direct method and indirect method.",
    "Example of Accounts Receivable": "A manufacturer will record an account receivable when it delivers a truckload of goods to a customer on June 1 and the customer is allowed to pay in 30 days. From June 1 until the company receives the money, the company will have an account receivable (and the customer will have an account payable).",
    "Definition of the Sum-of-the-Years’-Digits Depreciation": "The sum-of-the-years’-digits depreciation (SYD depreciation) is one method for calculating accelerated depreciation. (A more common method for calculating accelerated depreciation is the declining-balance method often used for U.S. income tax depreciation.) Compared to the straight-line depreciation method, the sum-of-the-years’-digits method results in greater depreciation in the earlier years of an asset’s useful life and less in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation over an asset’s useful life should be the same regardless of which depreciation method is used. In other words, the difference is in the timing of when the same total amount of depreciation will be reported.",
    "Example of the Sum-of-the-Years’-Digits Depreciation": "To illustrate SYD depreciation, assume that a service business purchases equipment at a cost of $160,000. This asset is expected to have a useful life of 5 years at which time it will be sold for $10,000. This means that the total amount of depreciation will be $150,000 spread over the equipment’s useful life of 5 years. The next step is to sum (or add up) the digits in the five years of this asset’s useful life: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The “15” will be the denominator for the fractions 5/15, 4/15, 3/15, etc. In the first full year of the asset’s life, 5/15 of the $150,000 = $50,000 will be debited to Depreciation Expense and $50,000 will be credited to Accumulated Depreciation. In the second full year of the asset’s life, the amount of depreciation will be $40,000 (4/15 of $150,000). In the third full year of the asset’s life, the depreciation will be $30,000 (3/15 of $150,000). The fourth year depreciation will be $20,000 (2/15 of $150,000), and the fifth year will be $10,000 (1/15 of $150,000). Remember that the total amount of depreciation during this asset’s useful life should be $150,000. Instead of adding the individual digits in the years of the asset’s useful life, the following formula can be used to compute the sum of the digits: n(n+1) divided by 2, where n = the useful life in years. Using this formula in our example of an asset with a useful life of 5 years, we have: 5(5+1)/2 = 5(6)/2 = 30/2 = 15. If the above formula is used for an asset having a useful life of 10 years, the sum of the digits will be:  10(10+1)/2 = 10(11)/2 = 110/2 = 55. In the first year of an asset with a 10-year useful life, the depreciation will be 10/55 of the amount to be depreciated. The second year will use 9/55 and the tenth year will use 1/55.",
    "Definition of Bad Debts": "The term bad debts usually refers to accounts receivable (or trade accounts receivable) that will not be collected. (Bad debts is also used for notes receivable that will not be collected.) The bad debts associated with accounts receivable is reported on the income statement as Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense.",
    "Examples of Recording Bad Debts": "There are two methods for recording the bad debts associated with accounts receivable:",
    "Definition of Deferred Expense": "A deferred expense refers to a cost that has occurred but it will be reported as an expense in one or more future accounting periods. To accomplish this, the deferred expense is reported on the balance sheet as an asset or a contra liability until it is moved from the balance sheet to the income statement as an expense. This is done to achieve the accountants’ matching principle. ",
    "Definition of Inventory Change": "Inventory change is the difference between the amount of last period’s ending inventory and the amount of the current period’s ending inventory. Under the periodic inventory system, there may also be an income statement account with the title Inventory Change or with the title (Increase) Decrease in Inventory. This account is presented as an adjustment to purchases in determining the company’s cost of goods sold. ",
    "Example of Inventory Change": "Let’s assume that last year’s ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year’s ending inventory is $115,000. Under the periodic inventory system, this inventory increase of $15,000 could be recorded as a debit of $15,000 to Inventory (thereby increasing the account balance from $100,000 to $115,000, and as a credit of $15,000 to Inventory Change. Next, assume that the company’s net purchases for the year amounted to a net debit of $300,000. This $300,000 debit and the credit of $15,000 in Inventory Change results in the cost of goods sold of $285,000. The logic is that not all $300,000 of net purchases should be matched against sales since $15,000 of the purchases were added to inventory. (This is an alternative to the method used in introductory accounting textbooks, which is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = $400,000 of cost of goods available – ending inventory of $115,000 = cost of goods sold of $285,000.) Alternatively, if last year’s ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year’s ending inventory is $93,000, there will be a credit to Inventory for $7,000 and a debit to Inventory Change for $7,000. When the debit of $7,000 in the Inventory Change account is combined with the debit of $300,000 in net purchases, the cost of goods sold is $307,000. (The alternative is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = cost of goods available of $400,000 – ending inventory of $93,000 = cost of goods sold of $307,000.)",
    "Definition of Provision for Doubtful Debts": "Some companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name of the contra-asset account which is reported on the company’s balance sheet. Other companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name for the current period’s expense that is reported on the company’s income statement. If Provision for Doubtful Debts is the name of the account used for recording the current period’s expense associated with the losses from normal credit sales, it will appear as an operating expense on the company’s income statement. It may be included in the company’s selling, general and administrative expenses. [However, if the expense is associated with extending credit outside of a company’s main selling activities, the credit loss will be reported as a nonoperating expense.]",
    "Example of Provision for Doubtful Debts": "Accounting textbooks avoid the use of the word “provision” and instead use the following terminology:",
    "Definition of Utility Bills": "Utility bills are invoices received by a company for the natural gas, electricity, water, and sewer charges that the company used during a previous month or other period of time. The usage and the amount of each bill is generally based on the meters located on the company’s property. In other words, the utilities provide the gas, electricity, etc. in advance of being paid. Therefore, the company is receiving the gas, electricity, etc. before it pays for them and has a liability until the bills are paid. ",
    "Example of Utility Bills": "Let’s assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and it uses natural gas for heating and it uses electricity for lighting and to operate its computers and equipment. Let’s assume that the utility reads the meters on the last day of every month and prepares the utility bills based on the meters’ readings. The retailer receives its first utility bills on January 8th and must remit the amount by February 2. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer’s income statement for the month of December must report the cost of the gas and electricity that it used during December. On its December 31 balance sheet, the retailer must report the amounts it owes to the utilities as of December 31. If the utility bills for December’s usage are not available at the time that the retailer’s financial statements are prepared, the retailer will record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Utilities Expense and credits Accrued Utilities Payable for December’s estimated amount. In our example, the utility bills for gas and electricity used in December are both an expense and a liability as of December 31. When the utility bills are paid, the liability is eliminated.",
    "Definition of Aging Method": "The aging method usually refers to the technique for estimating the amount of a company’s accounts receivable that will not be collected. The estimated amount that will not be collected should be the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The debit balance in Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts will result in the estimated amount of the receivables that will be converted to cash. The aging method sorts each customer’s unpaid invoices by invoice date into perhaps four columns:",
    "Example of Aging Method": "Let’s assume that a company’s Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $89,400. The aging method indicates that most of the customers are current. However, there are a few customers’ invoices that are more than 60 days past due. Those past due accounts are reviewed closely and based on each customer’s information it is estimated that approximately $7,400 of the $89,400 will not be collected. Therefore the credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts must be $7,400. This will result in the balance sheet reporting Accounts Receivable (Net) of $82,000.",
    "Definition of a Noncash Expense": "A noncash expense is an expense that is reported on the income statement of the current accounting period, but the related cash payment took place in another accounting period.",
    "Example of a Noncash Expense": "Perhaps the most common example of a noncash expense is depreciation. To illustrate, let’s assume that a company purchased equipment two years ago for a cash payment of $200,000. The company determined that the equipment had a useful life of 10 years. As a result, the company’s income statement will report depreciation expense of $20,000 a year for 10 years. The current year’s income statement is reporting depreciation expense of $20,000 but there is no cash payment in the current year for this expense. This is why depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense. This also explains why the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows usually begins with a company’s net income and then immediately adds the period’s depreciation expense. In effect the noncash depreciation expense is added back because the depreciation expense had reduced the company’s net income reported on the income statement, but it did not use any cash during that period of time. ",
    "Definition of Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts": "The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts or Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that reduces the amount of accounts receivable to the amount that is more likely be collected. The income statement account Bad Debts Expense is part of the adjusting entry that increases the balance in the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.",
    "Effect of No Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts": "If a company’s balance sheet does not reduce its accounts receivable debit balance with a credit balance in Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, the company is communicating that it is not anticipating any bad debts expense relating to its existing accounts receivable. Hence, the income statement is delaying the reporting of bad debts expense on its income statement until an account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible.",
    "Definition of Deferral": "A deferral often refers to an amount that was paid or received, but the amount cannot be reported on the current income statement since it will be an expense or revenue of a future accounting period. In other words, the future amount is deferred to a balance sheet account until a later accounting period when it will be moved to the income statement. Deferral is also used to describe the  type of adjusting entries used to defer amounts at the end of an accounting period.",
    "Examples of a Deferral": "Assume that a company with an accounting year ending on December 31 pays a six-month insurance premium of $12,000 on December 1 with insurance coverage beginning on December 1. One-sixth of the $12,000, or $2,000, should be reported as insurance expense on the December income statement. The remaining $10,000 is deferred by reporting it as a current asset such as prepaid insurance, on its December 31 balance sheet. A deferral also occurs with revenues. The insurance company receiving the $12,000 for the six-month insurance premium beginning December 1 should report $2,000 as insurance premium revenues on its December income statement. The remaining $10,000 should be deferred to a balance sheet liability account, such as Unearned Premium Revenues. In each subsequent month the insurance company will record an adjusting entry to reduce the liability account Unearned Premium Revenues by $2,000 and report $2,000 as Premium Revenues on its income statement.",
    "Defintion of an Interest Only Loan": "An interest only loan specifies that only interest payments are required during the life of the loan. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due.",
    "Example of an Interest Only Loan": "Assume that on July 1, a company borrows $100,000 with an annual interest rate of 12%. The interest for each month is to be paid on the last day of the month. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due in two years. On July 1 the company records the loan as follows:",
    "Definition of Deferred Cost": "A deferred cost is a cost that is already recorded in a company’s accounts, but at least some of the cost should not be expensed until a future accounting period.",
    "Examples of Deferred Cost": "Assume that a newly formed company paid $600 on December 30 for liability insurance for the six months that begins on January 1. For the next two days, none of the $600 will be reported as an expense. Instead, all $600 of cost is being deferred until the new year. Therefore, as of December 31, the company’s balance sheet will report $600 as the current asset Prepaid Insurance.  During the month of January, the company should report $100 of insurance expense. At the end of January, the company’s balance sheet should report Prepaid Insurance of $500 (indicating that $500 of the original $600 cost remains deferred). The capitalization of interest involved when a company constructs its own building is also a deferred cost. The reason is that the interest will be added to the cost of the building and then depreciated over the life of the building—instead of being expensed immediately as interest expense.",
    "Definition of Bad Debt and Doubtful Debt": "In accounting, the terms bad debt and doubtful debt usually refer to the amounts owed by a company’s customers who purchased goods or services but the amounts are likely to be uncollectible. The amount owed by customers are included in the balance of the current asset account Accounts Receivable. In other words, the terms bad debt and doubtful debt have the same meaning.",
    "Example of Bad Debt and Doubtful Debt": "Assume that $5,200 of a company’s $200,000 of accounts receivable are estimated to be uncollectible. For accounting purposes, the company should establish a current asset account entitled Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.  If the customers’ account are not yet written off, the Allowance account should report a credit balance of $5,200 so that the company’s balance sheet will report the net realizable value of $194,800.  If the balance in the Allowance account was $0, the company will write an adjusting entry to:",
    "Definition of Notes Payable and Notes Receivable": "Notes payable and notes receivable are both associated with a written note that promises to repay the amount borrowed plus interest. A single promissory note is both of the following:",
    "Example of Notes Payable and Notes Receivable": "Assume that Local Retailer borrows $20,000 from its bank and signs a promissory note due in six months. Local Retailer records $20,000 as a credit to its current liability account Notes Payable (and debits its Cash account). The bank records the $20,000 promissory note from Local Retailer in the bank’s current asset account Notes Receivable and it records the $20,000 as an increase in the customer’s checking account (which is part of the bank’s current liability account Customers’ Deposits). Since the promissory note is a contract to pay interest, both parties must report the interest as follows:",
    "Definition of Deferral Adjusting Entry": "A deferral adjusting entry (one of three types of adjusting entries) pertains to a transaction that has already been recorded in the general ledger accounts. However, at the time that the transaction was recorded, part of the amount must be reported as 1) revenue in a future period, or 2) expense in a future period. The deferral adjusting entry makes certain that the correct amounts will be reported on a company’s balance sheets and income statements. ",
    "Example of Deferral Adjusting Entry for Expenses": "Assume that on December 31, a company paid $12,000 for a maintenance agreement covering the next 12 months. The transaction was recorded on December 31 with a debit of $12,000 to the current asset Prepaid Expense and a credit of $12,000 to the current asset Cash. On January 31, the company should report that during the month of January it had Maintenance Expense of $1,000 and that its current asset Prepaid Expense now has a debit balance of $11,000. For these amounts to be reported on its financial statements, the following deferral adjusting entry must be made: debit Maintenance Expense for $1,000 and credit Prepaid Expense for $1,000.",
    "Example of Deferral Adjusting Entry for Revenues": "On December 31, a maintenance service company received $12,000 and agreed to provide the client with maintenance on its equipment for the next 12 months. The maintenance service company recorded the transaction on December 31 with a debit to Cash for $12,000 and a credit to the current liability account Deferred (or Unearned) Revenues for $12,000. On January 31, the maintenance service company should report that during the month of January it earned $1,000 and that its current liability account Deferred Revenues now has a credit balance of $11,000. For these amounts to be reported on its financial statements, the following deferral adjusting entry must be made: debit Deferred Revenues for $1,000 and credit Service Revenues for $1,000.",
    "Accrual Method for the Corporation, Cash Method for the Employees": "The short answer is that the corporation’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting (generally accepted accounting principles), while the employee payroll records for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the cash method of accounting.",
    "Example of the Corporation’s Wages Expense (Based on Work Dates)": "To illustrate, let’s assume that a new retailer (that uses the accrual method of accounting) begins operations on December 27. The employees working from December 27 through December 31 will receive their first paychecks on January 4. If the employees earn a total of $5,000 of wages during the five days ending on December 31, the retailer’s general ledger and financial statements for the period ending December 31 must report wages expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000 as of December 31. In accounting jargon, the retailer must accrue the expense and liability through an adjusting entry dated December 31.",
    "Example of the Employees’ Earnings Reported to IRS (Based on Pay Dates)": "The retailer’s payroll department must report to the IRS the wages paid. Therefore, the amount reported to the IRS is based on the pay dates. Since January 4 is the first time the employees will be paid, the employees’ wages earned during December 27-31 will be reported to the IRS as January wages.",
    "Definition of Financial Leverage": "Financial leverage which is also known as leverage or trading on equity, refers to the use of debt to acquire additional assets. The use of financial leverage to control a greater amount of assets (by borrowing money) will cause the returns on the owner’s cash investment to be amplified. That is, with financial leverage:",
    "Examples of Financial Leverage": "Mary uses $500,000 of her cash to purchase 40 acres of land with a total cost of $500,000. Mary is not using financial leverage. Sue uses $500,000 of her cash and borrows $1,000,000 to purchase 120 acres of land having a total cost of $1,500,000. Sue is using financial leverage to own/control $1,500,000 of property with only $500,000 of her own money. Let’s also assume that the interest on Sue’s loan is $50,000 per year and it is paid at the beginning of each year.",
    "Effects of Using Financial Leverage": "For our examples let’s assume that after one year, the land owned by Mary and the land owned by Sue increased in value by 20% and both Mary and Sue sold their land investments at the market values. As a result:",
    "Definition of Debt to Total Assets Ratio": "The debt to total assets ratio is an indicator of a company’s financial leverage. It tells you the percentage of a company’s total assets that were financed by creditors. In other words, it is the total amount of a company’s liabilities divided by the total amount of the company’s assets. Note: Debt includes more than loans and bonds payable. Debt is the total amount of all liabilities (current liabilities and long-term liabilities).",
    "Example of Debt to Total Assets Ratio": "Let’s assume that a corporation has $100 million in total assets, $40 million in total liabilities, and $60 million in stockholders’ equity. This corporation’s debt to total assets ratio is 0.4 ($40 million of liabilities divided by $100 million of assets), 0.4 to 1, or 40%. This indicates 40% of the corporation’s assets are being financed by the creditors, and the owners are providing 60% of the assets’ cost. Generally, the higher the debt to total assets ratio, the greater the financial leverage and the greater the risk.",
    "How To Be Used": "As with all financial ratios, it is best for a company to compare its debt to total assets ratio to:",
    "Definition of Current Assets": "Current assets include cash and assets that are expected to turn to cash within one year of the balance sheet date. Current assets also include prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year. If a company’s operating cycle is longer than one year, the length of the operating cycle is used in place of the one-year time period.",
    "Examples of Current Assets": "Examples of current assets and the typical order of liquidity include:",
    "Definition of Vertical Analysis": "Vertical analysis expresses each amount on a financial statement as a percentage of another amount.",
    "Example of Vertical Analysis of a Balance Sheet": "If a company’s inventory is $100,000 and its total assets are $400,000 the inventory will be expressed as 25% ($100,000 divided by $400,000). If cash is $8,000 then it will be presented as 2%($8,000 divided by $400,000). The total of the assets’ percentages will add up to 100%. If the accounts payable are $88,000 they will be restated as 22% ($88,000 divided by $400,000). If owner’s equity is $240,000 it will be shown as 60% ($240,000 divided by $400,000). The sum of the liabilities and owner’s equity will also be 100%. The vertical analysis of the balance sheet will result in a common-size balance sheet. The percentages on a common-size balance sheet allow you to compare a small company’s balance sheets to that of a very large company’s balance sheet. A common-size balance sheet can also be compared to the average percentages for the industry.",
    "Example of Vertical Analysis of an Income Statement": "If a company’s net sales were $1,000,000 they will be presented as 100% ($1,000,000 divided by $1,000,000). If the cost of goods sold amount is $780,000 it will be presented as 78% ($780,000 divided by sales of $1,000,000). If interest expense is $50,000 it will be presented as 5% ($50,000 divided by $1,000,000). The restated amounts result in a common-size income statement, since it can be compared to the income statement of a competitor of any size or to  the industry’s percentages.",
    "Definition of Horizontal Analysis": "Horizontal analysis looks at amounts from the financial statements over a horizon of many years. Horizontal analysis is also referred to as trend analysis. The amounts from past financial statements will be restated to be a percentage of the amounts from a base year. ",
    "Examples of Horizontal Analysis": "To illustrate horizontal analysis, let’s assume that a base year is five years earlier. All of the amounts on the balance sheets and the income statements will be expressed as a percentage of the base year amounts. The amounts from five years earlier are presented as 100% or simply 100. The amounts from the most recent years will be divided by the base year amounts. For instance, if a most recent year amount was three times as large as the base year, the most recent year will be presented as 300. If the previous year’s amount was twice the amount of the base year, it will be presented as 200. Seeing the horizontal analysis of every item allows you to more easily see the trends. It will be easy to detect that over the years the cost of goods sold has been increasing at a faster pace than the company’s net sales. From the balance sheet’s horizontal analysis you may see that inventory and accounts payable have been growing as a percentage of total assets. Vertical analysis, horizontal analysis and financial ratios are part of financial statement analysis.",
    "Definition of Current Asset": "A current asset is a company’s cash and its other assets that are expected to be converted to cash within one year of the date appearing in the heading of the company’s balance sheet. However, if a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, an asset that is expected to turn to cash within that longer operating cycle will be a current asset. Current assets are usually presented first on the company’s balance sheet and they are arranged in their order of liquidity. Current assets are also a key component of a company’s working capital and the current ratio.",
    "Definition of Days’ Sales in Accounts Receivable": "The days’ sales in accounts receivable ratio (also known as the average collection period) tells you the number of days it took on average to collect the company’s accounts receivable during the past year. ",
    "Example of Calculating Days’ Sales in Accounts Receivable": "The days’ sales in accounts receivable can be calculated as follows: the number of days in the year (use 360 or 365) divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio during a past year. For example, if a company’s accounts receivable turnover ratio for the past year was 10, the days’ sales in accounts receivable was 36 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10).",
    "Caution": "The accounts receivable turnover ratio used above was calculated as follows:",
    "Example of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts": "Let’s assume that a company has a debit balance in Accounts Receivable of $120,500 as a result of having sold goods on credit. Through the use of the aging method, the company sees that $18,000 of the receivables are 100 days past due. Upon further checking, the company believes that $10,000 of these receivables will never be collected. Thus, the account Allowance for Doubtful Account must have a credit balance of $10,000. If the present balance is $0, the journal entry will be a debit of $10,000 to Bad Debts Expense and a credit of $10,000 to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The balance sheet will now report Accounts Receivable of $120,500 less the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts of $10,000, for a net amount of $110,500. The income statement for the accounting period will report Bad Debts Expense of $10,000. Aging of Accounts Receivable Form and Template Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale – Corporation",
    "Definition of Current Liability": "A current liability is:",
    "Examples of Current Liabilities": "The following are common examples of current liabilities:",
    "Definition of Security Deposit": "A security deposit is often an amount paid by a tenant to a landlord to hold until the tenant moves. The amount of the security deposit is refundable to the tenant, if the rental unit remains in its present condition. Since the security deposit is refundable (and the tenant intends to comply with the specified conditions) the tenant that paid the security deposit will report the amount as an asset. If the tenant intends to occupy the rental unit for more than one year, the security deposit should be reported as a long-term asset (or noncurrent asset) under the balance sheet classification “Other assets”. The landlord that receives and holds the security deposit should report the amount as a liability.",
    "Example of a Security Deposit": "A company agrees to rent office space and intends to occupy the space for 3 years. The landlord requires a security deposit of $1,000. The company debits the long-term asset Security Deposit for $1,000 and credits Cash for $1,000. The landlord debits Cash for $1,000 and credits a liability account such as Refundable Security Deposits for $1,000.",
    "Definition of Quick Ratio": "The quick ratio (or the acid test ratio) is more conservative than the current ratio in that the amount in inventories, supplies, and prepaid expenses is not included. These current assets are excluded because it is assumed that they will not be turning to cash quickly. The quick ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of “quick assets” by 2) the amount of current liabilities. The quick ratio assumes that only the following current assets are “quick assets”:",
    "Example of Quick Ratio": "If a company’s cash and cash equivalents + marketable securities + accounts receivable adds up to $1,000,000 and the amount of the company’s current liabilities is $1,200,000, its quick ratio is 0.83 to 1 ($1,000,000/$1,200,000 = 0.83). The quick ratio differs from the current ratio in that some current assets are excluded from the quick ratio. The most significant current asset that is excluded is inventory. The reason is that inventory might not be “quick” to turn to cash.",
    "Definition of Gain or Loss on Sale of an Asset": "The gain or loss on the sale of an asset used in a business is the difference between 1) the amount of cash that a company receives, and 2) the asset’s book value (carrying value) at the time of the sale. In order to know the asset’s book value at the time of the sale, the depreciation expense for the asset must be recorded right up to the date that the asset is sold. If the cash received is greater than the asset’s book value, the difference is recorded as a gain. If the cash received is less than the asset’s book value, the difference is recorded as a loss.",
    "Example of a Gain on the Sale of an Asset": "On March 31, a company sells its old delivery van for $4,000. The van’s original cost was $45,000 and its accumulated depreciation was $43,600 as of the date of the sale. Therefore, the van’s book value as of March 31 was $1,400 (cost of $45,000 minus accumulated depreciation of $43,600). Since the $4,000 of cash received by the company was greater than the van’s book value of $1,400, there is a gain on the sale of the van of $2,600 ($4,000 minus $1,400). The gain could also be determined by preparing the journal entry for the transaction:",
    "Definition of Net Working Capital": "Net working capital is the amount (as opposed to being a ratio) remaining after subtracting a company’s total amount of current liabilities from its total amount of current assets. Hence, the formula is: net working capital = current assets minus current liabilities. (Net working capital is also known as working capital.)",
    "Examples of Changes in Working Capital": "If a company’s owners invest additional cash in the company, the cash will increase the company’s current assets with no increase in current liabilities. Therefore working capital will increase. If a company obtains a long-term loan to replace a current liability, current liabilities will decrease but current assets do not change. Therefore working capital will increase. If a company uses its cash to pay for a new vehicle or to expand one of its buildings, the company’s current assets will decrease with no change to current liabilities. Therefore working capital will decrease. If a company sells merchandise for $50,000 that was in inventory at a cost of $30,000, the company’s current assets will increase by $20,000. If no other expenses are incurred, working capital will increase by $20,000. If a company borrows $50,000 and agrees to repay the loan in 90 days, the company’s working capital is unchanged. The reason is that the current asset Cash increased by $50,000 and the current liability Loans Payable increased by $50,000. If a company collects $30,000 of its accounts receivable, there is no change in working capital since the current asset Cash increased, and another current asset Accounts Receivable decreased.",
    "Definition of Negative Cash Balance": "A negative cash balance results when the cash account in a company’s general ledger has a credit balance. The credit or negative balance in the checking account is usually caused by a company writing checks for more than it has in its checking account.",
    "Example of Reporting Negative Cash on the Balance Sheet": "When a company prepares its balance sheet, a negative balance in the cash account should be reported as a current liability which it might describe as checks written in excess of cash balance. The logic is that the company likely issued the checks to reduce its accounts payable. Since the issued checks will not be paid by the company’s bank, the company still has the liability. A negative cash balance in the general ledger does not mean that the company’s bank account is overdrawn. Let’s assume that a company writes checks for $100,000 and mails them at the end of the day to suppliers in another state. Those checks might not clear the company’s bank account until three or four days later. Therefore, it is possible that the company’s Cash account shows a negative $40,000 but at the bank the company’s checking account balance could have a positive balance of $60,000. If the company deposits at least $40,000 tomorrow morning, the bank balance will be large enough for the bank to pay the $100,000 of checks it had written.",
    "Definition of Construction Work-in-Progress": "Construction Work-in-Progress is a noncurrent asset account in which the costs of constructing long-term, fixed assets are recorded. The account Construction Work-in-Progress will have a debit balance and will be reported on the balance sheet as part of a company’s noncurrent or long-term asset section entitled  Property, plant and equipment. The costs of constructing the asset are accumulated in the account Construction Work-in-Progress until the asset is completed and placed into service. When the asset is placed into service, the account Construction Work-in-Progress will be credited for its balance (the accumulated costs) and will be recorded with a debit in the appropriate property, plant and equipment account. Depreciation will begin after the asset is put into service.",
    "Example of Construction Work-in-Progress": "Let’s assume that a company is expanding its warehouse and the project is expected to take four months to complete. The company will open the account Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to accumulate the many expenditures that will occur. When the project is completed, the company will transfer the amount from Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to the asset account Warehouse Expansion.",
    "Examples of Capitalized Costs": "When a company constructs a new building, the interest incurred to finance its construction is capitalized. This means that the interest during construction will be part of the cost of the building (a noncurrent or long-term asset). The total cost will then be depreciated over the building’s useful life. (On the other hand, interest to finance the company’s operations or to build equipment is not capitalized. This interest is reported immediately as interest expense on the income statement.) If a company purchases an old machine in need of complete updating, the cost of the new components and the labor to rebuild the machine will be capitalized. This means that the total cost of the machine will be allocated to Depreciation Expense over the years of the machine’s useful life. (On the other hand, the expenditures to get a machine back to its previous working condition are not capitalized. These expenditures should be charged immediately to Repairs and Maintenance Expense.)",
    "Definition of Carrying Amount": "The term carrying amount is also known as book value or carrying value. The term carrying amount is often used when there is a valuation account associated with another general ledger account.  ",
    "Examples of Carrying Amount": "Here are some examples when the term carrying amount or carrying value is used:",
    "Definition of Days’ Sales in Inventory": "The financial ratio days’ sales in inventory tells you the number of days it took a company to sell its inventory during a recent year. Keep in mind that a company’s inventory will change throughout the year, and its sales will fluctuate as well. Therefore, you should view this as an average from the past. The calculation of the days’ sales in inventory is: the number of days in a year (365 or 360 days) divided by the inventory turnover ratio.",
    "Example of Days’ Sales in Inventory": "To illustrate the days’ sales in inventory, let’s assume that in the previous year a company had an inventory turnover ratio of 9. Using 360 as the number of days in the year, the company’s days’ sales in inventory was 40 days (360 days divided by 9). Since sales and inventory levels usually fluctuate during a year, the 40 days is an average from a previous time. It is important to realize that a financial ratio will likely vary between industries. Hence, a company’s ratios should be compared to its own past financial ratios and to the ratios of companies within its industry. ",
    "Definition of Drawings": "Drawings are the withdrawals of a sole proprietorship’s business assets by the owner for the owner’s personal use. The drawings or draws by the owner (L. Webb) are recorded in an owner’s equity account such as L. Webb, Drawings; L. Webb, Draws; or L. Webb, Withdrawals. The other part of the entry will reduce the specific business asset.",
    "Example of Drawings": "If the owner (L. Webb) draws $5,000 of cash from her business, the accounting entry will be a debit of $5,000 to the account L. Webb, Drawings and a credit of $5,000 to the account Cash.",
    "Effect of Drawings on the Financial Statements": "The owner’s drawings will affect the company’s balance sheet by decreasing the asset that is withdrawn and by the decrease in owner’s equity. The owner’s drawings of cash will also affect the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. (If an asset other than cash is withdrawn, it is reported as supplemental information on the statement of cash flows.) The income statement is not affected by the owner’s drawings since the drawings are not business expenses.",
    "Definition of Net Realizable Value": "Net realizable value (NRV) is the cash amount that a company expects to receive. Hence, net realizable value is sometimes referred to as cash realizable value. We often find the term net realizable value being associated with the current assets accounts receivable and inventory. While these two assets are initially recorded at cost, there are occasions when the company will collect less than the cost. When that occurs, the company must report the lower of 1) cost, or 2) the net realizable value.   In the case of accounts receivable, net realizable value can also be expressed as the debit balance in the asset account Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.  In the context of inventory, net realizable value is the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.",
    "Examples of Net Realizable Value": "If Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $100,000 and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts has a proper credit balance of $8,000, the resulting net realizable value of the accounts receivable is $92,000. Adjustments to the Allowance account are reported on the income statement as bad debts expense. Now, let’s assume that a company’s inventory has a cost of $15,000. However, at the end of the accounting year the inventory can be sold for only $14,000 after it spends $2,000 for packaging, sales commissions, and shipping. Therefore, the net realizable value of the inventory is $12,000 (selling price of $14,000 minus $2,000 of costs to dispose of the goods). In that situation the inventory must be reported at the lower of 1) the cost of $15,000, or 2) the NRV of $12,000. In this situation, the inventory should be reported on the balance sheet at $12,000, and the income statement should report a loss of $3,000 due to the write-down of inventory.",
    "Definition of Notes Receivable": "Notes receivable is an asset of a company, bank or other organization that holds a written promissory note from another party. (The other party will have a note payable.) The principal part of a note receivable that is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date is reported in the current asset section of the lender’s balance sheet. The remaining principal of the note receivable is reported in the noncurrent asset section entitled Investments.",
    "Examples of Notes Receivable": "A company lends one of its important suppliers $10,000 and the supplier gives the company a written promissory note to repay the amount in six months along with interest at 8% per year. The company will debit its current asset account Notes Receivable for the principal amount of $10,000. The credit of $10,000 will be to Cash.  If a company borrows $100,000 from its bank and signs a promissory note to pay 6% interest quarterly and the principal amount in 9 months, the bank will debit its current asset account Notes Receivable and will credit Cash or Customers’ Deposits for the principal amount of $100,000.",
    "Definition of Current Portion of Long-Term Debt": "The current portion of long-term debt is the amount of principal that will be due within one year of the date of the balance sheet. This amount is reported on the balance sheet as one of the company’s current liabilities. (A company in an industry where the operating cycle is longer than one year, will report the amount of principal due within the length of the operating cycle as a current liability.)",
    "Example of Current Portion of Long Term Debt": "Let’s assume that a company has just borrowed $100,000 and signed a note requiring monthly payments of principal and interest for 48 months. Let’s also assume that the loan repayment schedule shows that the monthly principal payments for the 12 months after the date of the balance sheet add up to $18,000. The current liability section of the balance sheet will report Current portion of long term debt of $18,000. The remaining amount of principal due at the balance sheet date will be reported as a noncurrent or long-term liability. ",
    "Definition of Working Capital Turnover Ratio": "The working capital turnover ratio is also referred to as net sales to working capital. It indicates a company’s effectiveness in using its working capital. The working capital turnover ratio is calculated as follows: net annual sales divided by the average amount of working capital during the same year.",
    "Example of Working Capital Turnover Ratio": "To illustrate the working capital turnover ratio, let’s assume that a company’s net sales for the most recent year were $2,400,000 and its average amount of working capital during the year was $400,000. Therefore, its working capital turnover ratio was: net sales of $2,400,000 divided by average working capital of $400,000 = 6 times during the year. As with most financial ratios, you should compare the working capital turnover ratio to other companies in the same industry and to the same company’s past and planned working capital turnover ratios.",
    "What is a Plant Asset": "A plant asset is an asset with a useful life of more than one year that is used in producing revenues in a business’s operations. Plant assets are also known as fixed assets. Plant assets are recorded at their cost and depreciation expense is recorded during their useful lives. Plant assets (other than land) are depreciated over their useful lives and each year’s depreciation is credited to a contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation. Plant assets and the related accumulated depreciation are reported on a company’s balance sheet in the noncurrent asset section entitled property, plant and equipment. Accounting rules also require that the plant assets be reviewed for possible impairment losses.",
    "Examples of Plant Assets": "Plant assets include:",
    "Definition of Par Value": "Par value is a per share amount that will appear on some stock certificates and in the corporation’s articles of incorporation. (Some states may require a corporation to have a par value while others states do not require a par value.) (Par value can also refer to an amount that appears on bond certificates.) In the case of common stock the par value per share is usually a very small amount such as $0.10 or $0.01 and it has no connection to the market value of the share of stock. The par value is sometimes referred to as the common stock’s legal capital. When a corporation’s common or preferred stock has a par value, corporation’s balance sheet will report the total par value of the shares issued for each class of stock. This will be shown as a separate amount in the paid-in capital or contributed capital section of stockholders’ equity.",
    "Example of Par Value": "Let’s assume that a share of common stock has a par value of $0.01 and is sold to an investor for $25. The corporation issuing the stock will debit Cash for $25.00 and will credit Common Stock for $0.01 and will credit Additional Paid-in Capital for $24.99.",
    "Definition of a Mortgage Loan Payable": "The account Mortgage Loan Payable contains the principal amount owed on a mortgage loan. (Any interest that has accrued since the last payment should be reported as Interest Payable, a current liability. Future interest is not reported on the balance sheet.) Any principal that is to be paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability. The remaining amount of principal is reported as a long-term liability (or noncurrent liability).",
    "Example of a Mortgage Loan Payable": "Let’s assume that a company has a mortgage loan payable of $238,000 and is required to make monthly payments of approximately $4,500 per month. Each of the monthly payments includes a $3,000 principal payment plus an interest payment of approximately $1,500. This means that during the next 12 months, the company will be required to repay $36,000 ($3,000 x 12 months) of the loan’s principal. Therefore $36,000 is reported as a current liability. The remaining principal of $202,000 ($238,000 minus $36,000) is reported as a long-term (or noncurrent) liability since this amount will not be due within one year of the balance sheet date. You can find the amount of principal due within the next year by reviewing the loan’s amortization schedule or by asking your lender.",
    "Definition of Premium or Discount on Bonds Payable": "The premium or discount on bonds payable is the difference between the amount received by the corporation issuing the bonds and the par value or face amount of the bonds. If the amount received is greater than the par value, the difference is known as the premium on bonds payable. If the amount received is less than the par value, the difference is known as the discount on bonds payable. The premium and discount accounts are viewed as valuation accounts. The unamortized premium on bonds payable will have a credit balance that increases the carrying amount (or the book value) of the bonds payable. The unamortized discount on bonds payable will have a debit balance and that decreases the carrying amount (or book value) of the bonds payable. The premium or discount is to be amortized to interest expense over the life of the bonds. Hence, the balance in the premium or discount account is the unamortized balance.",
    "Where the Premium or Discount on Bonds Payable is Presented": "The premium or the discount on bonds payable that has not yet been amortized to interest expense will be reported immediately after the par value of the bonds in the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Generally, if the bonds are not maturing within one year of the balance sheet date, the amounts will be reported in the long-term or noncurrent liabilities section of the balance sheet. ",
    "Definition of Book Value": "In accounting, book value refers to the amounts contained in the company’s general ledger accounts (or books). It is important to realize that the book value is not the same as the fair market value because of the accountants’ historical cost principle and matching principle. Book value of an asset is: the asset’s cost minus the asset’s accumulated depreciation.  Book value of the liability Bonds Payable is the combination of the following:",
    "Examples of Book Value Calculations": "If a company’s computer system had a cost of $300,000 and it has accumulated depreciation of $80,000, the computer system has a book value of $220,000.  If a company has issued bonds with a maturity value of $40,000,000 and its current balance sheet reports Unamortized Bond Discount of $800,000 and Unamortized Bond Issue Costs of $200,000, the book value of the bonds is $39,000,000. If a corporation’s balance sheet reports stockholders’ equity of $245,000, the corporation’s book value is that amount.",
    "Reminder Concerning Book Value": "Book value does not indicate the current market value. In our examples:",
    "Definition of Commissions Revenues or Expenses": "The company or person earning and receiving commissions (such as a percentage of sales) will have commissions revenue. The company or party that pays the commissions will have commissions expense. ",
    "Accounting for Commissions Revenues": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, the commissions do not have to be received in order to be reported as revenues. If a company has earned the commissions but has not yet received the money, the company should make an accrual adjusting entry so that its income statement will report the commissions revenues and its balance sheet will report the commissions receivable.",
    "Accounting for Commissions Expense": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, the commissions do not have to be paid in order for the company to report commissions expense. If a company owes for commissions on recent sales, but has not yet paid or recorded them, an accrual adjusting entry is made so they are included in the commissions expense reported on its income statement and are also reported as commissions payable (or included in accrued liabilities) on its balance sheet.",
    "Definition of LIFO Reserve": "The LIFO reserve is a contra inventory account that indicates the difference between the following:",
    "Example of LIFO Reserve": "A U.S. company’s accounting system uses FIFO, but the company wants its financial and income tax reporting to use LIFO due to the persistent increases in the cost of its inventory items. LIFO will result in the company’s recent higher costs being included in the cost of goods sold. As a result, the company will report less gross profit, less net income, less taxable income, and less income taxes than the FIFO cost flow assumption. LIFO also results in the company’s older, lower costs remaining in inventory. With consistently increasing costs (and stable or increasing quantities of inventory items) the balance in the LIFO reserve account will be an ever-increasing credit balance that reduces the company’s general ledger inventory account balance under FIFO.",
    "Definition of Fixed Assets": "Fixed assets are a company’s tangible, noncurrent assets that are used in its business operations. The word fixed  indicates that these assets will not be used up, consumed, or sold in the current accounting year. A company’s fixed assets are reported in the noncurrent (or long-term) asset section of the balance sheet in the section described as property, plant and equipment. The fixed assets except for land will be depreciated and their accumulated depreciation will also be reported under property, plant and equipment.",
    "Examples of Fixed Assets": "Some of a manufacturer’s fixed assets include:",
    "Example of Inventory Cost and Cost of Goods Sold": "To show the connection between inventory and the cost of goods sold, let’s assume that a retailer sells only one product. Let’s also assume that the retailer begins the year with 100 units of the product and purchases an additional 1,500 units throughout the year. The combination of the beginning inventory plus the purchases is known  as the goods available for sale, which in this example is 1,600 units. If there are 125 units on hand at the end of the year, the ending inventory will report the cost of 125 units. The cost of goods sold for the year will be the cost of the 1,475 units that are no longer available.",
    "Definition of Acid Test Ratio": "The acid test ratio uses only the following current assets (which are considered to be the “quick assets”) and divides their total by the total amount of current liabilities:",
    "Example of Acid Test Ratio": "Let’s illustrate the acid test ratio by assuming that a company has cash of $7,000 + temporary marketable securities of $20,000 + accounts receivables of $93,000. This adds up to $120,000 of quick assets. If the company’s current liabilities amount to $100,000 the acid test ratio is 1.2:1. A large acid test ratio gives creditors confidence that the company will be able to meet its current obligations when they come due.",
    "Advantages of Issuing Bonds Instead of Stock": "There are several advantages of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of issuing shares of common stock:",
    "Example of Recording a Bond Issue": "Assume that a corporation issues $100 million of bonds payable at an annual interest rate of 5%. The bonds are offered when the market interest rate is 5.1% and there was no accrued interest. As a result, the investors paid $99.5 million for the bonds. The corporation also incurred $1 million of bond issue costs which were paid from bonds’ proceeds. The entry to record the issuance of the bonds is:",
    "Definition of Inventory Turnover Ratio": "The inventory turnover ratio is often calculated by dividing a company’s cost of goods sold for a recent year by the average amount of inventory during that year. The result is the average number of times that the company’s inventory had been sold. The goal is to have an inventory turnover ratio as large as possible without losing sales and/or customers.",
    "How to Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio": "The calculation for the inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold for a year divided by average inventory during the same 12 months.  A higher inventory turnover ratio is viewed as better than a lower ratio. Note: The cost of goods sold is used (not sales) in calculating the inventory turnover ratio because the company’s inventory is recorded and reported at its cost (not at its selling prices). However, be cautioned that some people will use sales and therefore will be overstating the inventory turnover ratio. It is also important to use the average amount of inventory throughout the entire year since using only the end-of-the-year amounts may result in a much lower average.",
    "Example of Inventory Turnover Ratio": "To illustrate the inventory turnover ratio, let’s assume that during the most recent year a company’s cost of goods sold was $3,600,000 and the average cost of its inventory account during the year was $400,000. As a result, the company’s inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold of $3,600,000 divided by average inventory of $400,000 =  9 times during the recent year. This could be compared to the company’s ratio in previous years and to other companies in the same industry. Even with a favorable inventory turnover ratio, a company may have some excess and obsolete inventory items. Therefore, it is wise to compare the quantity of each item in inventory to the quantity of each item sold during the past year.",
    "Definition of Overstating Inventory": "Overstating inventory means that the reported amount for the cost of a company’s inventory is greater than the actual true cost based on accounting rules. In other words, the reported amount is:",
    "Examples of the Effect of Overstating Inventory": "If a corporation overstates its inventory, it will affect the following reported amounts on the corporation’s income statement:",
    "Definition of Common Stock": "Common stock refers to the shares of ownership interest in a U.S. corporation.  The owners of the common stock are referred to as common stockholders, common shareholders, or simply as stockholders or shareholders. [A relatively few corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock.] Generally, the holders of common stock:",
    "Example of Common Stock": "Assume a corporation has been authorized by the state in which it is organized to issue 500,000 shares of common stock with no par value. If the corporation actually issues only 100,000 shares for $50 each, the corporation will debit its Cash account for $5,000,000 and will credit its account Common Stock for $5,000,000. The corporation will now have 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding. If a stockholder owns 1,000 shares of the common stock, the stockholder owns 1% of the corporation. If the corporation declares a divided of $0.10 per share, this stockholder will receive a dividend of $100 (1,000 shares X $0.10).",
    "Definition of Interest": "Interest on a corporation’s bonds and other debt is an expense of the corporation and it reduces the corporation’s net income. For profitable corporations, interest expense also reduces its taxable income and the corresponding income tax expense. The income tax savings ultimately reduces the net cost of the interest paid. Since the corporation entered into a contract to pay interest to its lenders, if the interest is not paid the corporation can face legal consequences. As a result, any accrued interest expense and the related liability must be recorded by the corporation.",
    "Example of Dividends vs. Interest": "If a profitable corporation declares and pays cash dividends of $100,000, the corporation’s cash and its retained earnings (and therefore its stockholders’ equity) are reduced by $100,000. However, the corporation’s net income is not reduced as dividends are not a business expense. Assume that a different profitable corporation pays $100,000 in interest to its lenders. The $100,000 will appear on the corporation’s income statement as interest expense and will reduce the line net income before income tax expense and the line income tax expense. If the corporation’s incremental combined federal and local income tax rate is 30%, the corporation will reduce its income tax expense and tax payments by $30,000. This means that the corporation’s net cost of the borrowed money is $70,000 ($100,000 of interest paid to lenders minus $30,000 of income tax savings). ",
    "Difference Between FIFO and LIFO": "The difference between FIFO and LIFO will exist only if the unit costs of a company’s products are increasing or decreasing. U.S. companies may elect either the FIFO or the FIFO cost flow assumptions. However, after making a change, a company cannot switch back. For U.S. income tax reporting, a company must use the same cost flow assumption as it uses on its financial statements.",
    "Example of Difference Between FIFO and LIFO": "Let’s assume that a retail store carried only one product during its first year of business. It purchased 30 units in January at a cost of $40 each, 30 units in June at $43 each, and 30 units in November at $46 each. Thus, for the year the retailer purchased 90 units with a total actual cost of $3,870 [30@$40 + 30@$43 + 30@$46]. Let’s also assume that 70 units were sold and that 20 units remain in inventory at the end of the year. Using FIFO the company assumes that first costs (the oldest costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory and will become the cost of goods sold. Therefore, the FIFO cost of the 70 units sold had a cost of $2,950 [30@$40 + 30@$43 + 10@$46]. FIFO also means the 20 units remaining in inventory had the most recent cost of $46 each for a total of $920. Using LIFO and the periodic inventory system, the company assumes that the last costs (the most recent actual costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory first and will become the cost of goods sold regardless of which units were physically shipped to customers. Therefore, the LIFO cost of the 70 units sold is $3,070 [30@$46 + 30@$43 + 10@$40]. LIFO also means that the 20 units remaining in inventory had the oldest cost of $40 each for a total of $800. In our example, LIFO results in $120 less of ending inventory ($800 vs. $920), $120 more of cost of goods sold, and therefore $120 less of gross profit. The lower gross profit and the associated lower taxable income for a U.S. company can result in less taxable income, which may result in less income tax payments for a profitable corporation.",
    "Definition of Debt Ratio": "The debt ratio is also known as the debt to asset ratio or the total debt to total assets ratio. Hence, the formula for the debt ratio is: total liabilities divided by total assets. The debt ratio indicates the percentage of the total asset amounts (as reported on the balance sheet) that is owed to creditors. The larger the debt ratio the greater is the company’s financial leverage. The appropriate debt ratio depends on the industry and factors that are unique to the company. ",
    "Example of Debt Ratio": "Assume that a corporation’s balance sheet reports total liabilities of $60,000 and total assets of $100,000. The corporation’s debt ratio is 0.60 or 60% ($60,000 divided by $100,000).",
    "Definition of Product Warranty Liability": "A product warranty means the manufacturer or seller has a potential liability and expense if its product or service fails to live up to the warranty during the period of the warranty. This type of warranty is referred to as an assurance-type warranty.  In accounting jargon, the assurance-type warranty is an example of a contingent that is both probable and can be estimated. Therefore, a company must record in the period of the sale the estimated cost of repairing or replacing the product during the warranty period. That expected cost is recorded as a liability on its balance sheet and as an expense on its income statement. Note that the expected future cost to repair or replace is matched with the sales revenue in the period of the sale. When the repair or replacement occurs, the warranty liability is reduced.  Think of those future repair/replacement costs as a selling or promotion expense to get the sale to occur. Periodically, the credit balance in the Warranty Liability account is reviewed to be certain that the estimated amounts were reasonable. If they are not, the amount recorded at the time of each sale will be increased or decreased.",
    "Example of Product Warranty Liability": "Assume that an automobile manufacturer has found that it spends $1,000 in labor and parts for the necessary repairs covered under its two year warranty. If the manufacturer sells 5,000 cars in the first month of its accounting year, the manufacturer must debit Warranty Expense for $5,000,000 (5,000 cars X $1,000)and will credit Warranty Liability for $5,000,000. When warranty work is done, the manufacturer debits Warranty Liability for the actual cost and will credit Parts Inventory, Wages Payable, etc.",
    "Difference between Current Ratio and Quick Ratio": "To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and the quick ratio, assume that a company’s balance sheet reports current assets of $60,000 and current liabilities of $40,000. Its current assets include $35,000 of inventory and $1,000 of supplies and prepaid expenses. These amounts result in the following:",
    "Definition of Liquidity": "Liquidity usually refers to a company’s ability to pay its bills when they become due. Liquidity is often evaluated by comparing a company’s current assets to its current liabilities. The following are often referred to as liquidity ratios  or short-term solvency ratios since they assist in evaluating a company’s ability to pay its current obligations:",
    "Current Assets": "Generally, the assets that are expected to turn to cash within one year are reported on the balance sheet in the section with the heading current assets. Current assets are listed in the order in which they are expected to turn to cash. This is known as the order of liquidity. Since cash is the most liquid asset, it is listed first. After cash, the order is: temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, supplies, and prepaid expenses.",
    "Evaluating Liquidity": "Liquidity depends on 1) the speed at which the assets should be turning to cash, or 2) the assets’ nearness to cash. For example, some temporary investments are marketable and can be converted to cash very quickly. Accounts receivable may be converted to cash in 10 to 40 days. However, inventory may require several months to be sold and the money collected. Hence, inventory is not considered to be a “quick asset.” To assist in evaluating a company’s liquidity, the financial ratio known as the quick ratio or acid-test ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the company’s quick assets (cash, temporary investments, and accounts receivable) by the amount of the company’s current liabilities. [An alternate calculation of the quick ratio is to begin with the amount of the current assets and subtract the amount of inventory. The remainder is then divided by the amount of current liabilities.]",
    "Some Inventory May Not Provide Liquidity": "While the current ratio is also referred to as a liquidity ratio, a company with the majority of its current assets in inventory may or may not have the liquidity needed to pay its liabilities as they come due. Its liquidity depends on the speed in which the inventory can be converted to cash.",
    "Definition of Treasury Stock": "Treasury stock is usually a corporation’s previously issued shares of common stock that have been purchased from the stockholders, but the corporation has not retired the shares. The number of shares of treasury stock (or treasury shares) is the difference between the number of shares issued and the number of shares outstanding. Since the treasury shares result in fewer shares outstanding, there may be a slight increase in the corporation’s earnings per share. Treasury Stock is also the title of a general ledger account that will have a debit balance equal to the cost of the repurchased shares being held by the corporation. The corporation’s cost of treasury stock reduces the corporation’s cash and the total amount of stockholders’ equity. The shares of treasury stock will not receive dividends, will not have voting rights, and cannot result in an income statement gain or loss. The shares of treasury stock can be sold, retired, or could continue to be held as treasury stock.",
    "Example of Treasury Stock": "A corporation has excess cash and does not see any attractive investments. As a result, it decides to purchase 10,000 shares of its 300,000 shares of common stock that is held by its stockholders. The market value of the 10,000 shares is $40 per share. The corporation’s entry to record the purchase of these shares of stock is:",
    "Example of Bonds Payable": "Usually public utilities issue bonds to help finance a new electric power plant, hospitals issue bonds for new buildings, and governments issue bonds to finance projects, operating deficits, or to redeem older bonds that are maturing. For example, a profitable public utility might finance half of the cost of a new electricity generating power plant by issuing 30-year bonds. If the current market interest rate for the bonds is 4%, the cost after the income tax savings may be only 3%.",
    "Definition of Bond Sinking Fund": "A bond sinking fund is an investment made by a corporation that is restricted for the purpose of retiring its bonds payable, which is a long-term liability. Since the money in the sinking fund is restricted for a long-term purpose, it cannot be used to pay its short-term liabilities. Therefore, the sinking fund is not a current asset nor is it part of the corporation’s working capital.",
    "Example of Bond Sinking Fund": "ABC Corporation is planning to issue $20 million of 20-year bonds. Potential investors are requiring that ABC establish a bond sinking fund into which ABC will make annual deposits of $500,000. An independent trustee will invest the corporation’s annual deposits with the goal of the sinking fund balance growing to approximately $20 million by the time the bonds come due in 20 years. The corporation will report the bond sinking fund balance in the investments section of its balance sheet. The investments section appears immediately after the current asset section. ",
    "Definition of Capital Expenditures": "Capital expenditures are the amounts spent for tangible assets that will be used for more than one year in the operations of a business. Capital expenditures, which are sometimes referred to as capex, can be thought of as the amounts spent to acquire or improve a company’s fixed assets. The capital expenditures increase the respective asset accounts which are reported in the noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet entitled property, plant and equipment. Once the assets (except for land) are placed in service they are depreciated over their useful lives. The accumulated depreciation for these assets is also reported as part of the property, plant and equipment. The amount of capital expenditures for an accounting period is also reported in the cash flow statement as a negative amount (since it is a cash outflow) in the investing activities section. Many financial analysts subtract the capital expenditures amount from the cash from operating activities to arrive at the company’s free cash flow.",
    "Example of Current Ratio and Acid Test Ratio": "To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and the acid test ratio, let’s assume that a company has the following:",
    "Example of Reporting a Sinking Fund on the Balance Sheet": "A corporation’s bond sinking fund appears in the first noncurrent asset section of the corporation’s balance sheet. This section is likely to have the heading Investments. The bond sinking fund is a noncurrent (or long-term) asset even if the fund contains only cash. The reason is the cash in the sinking fund must be used to retire bonds and cannot be used to pay current liabilities.",
    "Definition of Accounts Receivable Collection Period": "The accounts receivable collection period is similar to the days sales outstanding or the days sales in accounts receivable. The accounts receivable collection period is calculated as follows:",
    "Example of Accounts Receivable Collection Period": "Assume a corporation had net credit sales of $360,000 during the past year and its accounts receivable balance was on average $40,000. The average credit sales per day were approximately $1,000 per day ($360,000 of annual credit sales divided by 360 or 365 days per year). The average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 divided by $1,000 of credit sales per day = 40 days. Calculating the accounts receivable collection period using the accounts receivable turnover ratio, you first determine the accounts receivable turnover ratio. The calculation is $360,000 of net credit sales divided by the average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 = 9. Next, divide 360 days per year by the accounts receivable turnover of 9 = 40 days.",
    "Definition of Current Liabilities and Long-term Liabilities": "Generally, current liabilities are a company’s obligations that are due within one year of the balance sheet’s date and will require a cash payment or will need to be renewed. Long-term (or noncurrent) liabilities are the obligations that are not due within one year of the balance sheet date and will not require a cash payment. Typically, companies issue classified balance sheets. This means that the current assets and current liabilities are listed in separate sections of the balance sheet. The classified balance sheets allow the users of this financial statement to quickly determine the amount of the company’s working capital and current ratio. Both of these metrics are useful in determining a company’s ability to meet its current or short-term obligations.",
    "Examples of Current Liabilities and Long-term Liabilities": "Often a company’s current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventories. It’s current liabilities typically include accounts payable, loan payments due within one year of the balance sheet date, and wages payable. Long-term liabilities may include loan principal payments not due within one year of the balance sheet date. For example, a mortgage loan on a company’s building will likely have 12 monthly payments due within one year of the balance sheet date and perhaps an additional 60 monthly payments due after the balance sheet date. The principal portion of those monthly payments (not the interest portion since the interest is not yet a liability) is reported on the balance sheet. It is possible that a mortgage principal balance of $150,000 will mean a current liability of $15,000 and a long-term liability of $135,000. Assume that the total amount of company’s current assets is $120,000, and the total amount of its current liabilities is $100,000. This means the company’s working capital is $20,000 and its current ratio is 1.2 ($120,000 / $100,000). Being able to quickly see that the company has only $20,000 in working capital is important information for the company, its investors, and its creditors. ",
    "Definition of Other Comprehensive Income": "Other comprehensive income, or OCI, consists of items that have an effect on the balance sheet amounts, but the effect is not reported on the company’s income statement. Instead, these changes are reported on the statement of comprehensive income along with the amount of net income from the income statement. Since the OCI items do not affect the net income, they do not cause a change in a corporation’s retained earnings. Instead, the current period’s OCI items cause a change in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a different component of stockholders’ equity.",
    "Examples of Other Comprehensive Income": "Some examples of the items classified as other comprehensive income include:",
    "Difference between Current Ratio and Working Capital": "To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and working capital, assume that a company’s balance sheet reports current assets of $60,000 and current liabilities of $40,000. These amounts result in the following:",
    "Definition of Discount on Bonds Payable": "Discount on bonds payable (or bond discount) occurs when a corporation issues bonds and receives less than the bonds’ face or maturity amount. The root cause of the bond discount is the bonds have a stated interest rate which is lower than the market interest rate for similar bonds. The difference between the amount received and the face or maturity amount is recorded in the corporation’s general ledger contra liability account Discount on Bonds Payable. This amount will then be amortized to Bond Interest Expense over the life of the bonds. ",
    "Example of Discount on Bonds Payable": "Assume that a corporation prepares to issue bonds having a maturity amount of $10,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6% (per year). However, when the bonds are actually sold to investors, the market interest rate is 6.1%. Since these bonds will be paying the investors less than the market rate of interest ($300,000 semiannually instead of $305,000), the investors will pay less than $10,000,000 for the bonds.  Assume the investors pay $9,800,000 for the bonds having a face or maturity value of $10,000,000. The difference of $200,000 will be recorded by the issuing corporation as a debit to Discount on Bonds Payable, a debit to Cash for $9,800,000, and a credit to Bonds Payable for $10,000,000. Over the life of the bonds, the initial debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable will decrease as it is amortized to Bond Interest Expense. The combination of the unamortized debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable, the unamortized debit balance in Bond Issue Costs, and the $10,000,000 credit balance in Bonds Payable is referred to as the book value (or carrying value) of the bonds payable.",
    "Definition of Direct Materials": "Direct materials are defined as:",
    "Examples of Raw Materials": "The direct materials for a bakery’s products will likely be flour, sugar, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, spices, and other ingredients listed in the bakery’s recipes. The direct materials for a manufactured product will appear in each product’s bill of materials.  Note: A manufacturer’s indirect materials such as lubricants and other manufacturing supplies will be allocated to products along with other costs that are part of manufacturing overhead.",
    "Definition of Working Capital Ratio": "The working capital ratio is defined as the amount of a company’s current assets divided by the amount of its current liabilities. Hence, the working capital ratio is the same as the current ratio. The working capital ratio (or current ratio) is one indicator of a company’s ability to pay its current obligations.",
    "Example of Working Capital Ratio": "If a company has $600,000 of current assets and has $400,000 of current liabilities, its working capital ratio is $600,000 divided by $400,000 = 1.5 or 1.5 to 1. Whether this ratio is good or bad, sufficient or insufficient, etc. depends on many factors including the composition of the company’s current assets, the speed at which the company’s sales turn into cash, the credit terms of its suppliers, the company’s long-term investments (if any), the amount of its long-term debt, competitors’ credit terms, the company’s profitability, etc.",
    "Definition of Solvency": "I use the term solvency to mean a company is able to 1) pay its obligations when they come due, and 2) continue in business. Some people look to a company’s working capital to decide whether a company is solvent. They conclude that a company with a positive amount of working capital is solvent. This is a short run view since the focus is on the company’s current assets and its current liabilities. Others look at a company’s total assets and total liabilities or the company’s debt to equity ratio when deciding whether a company is solvent. A company’s solvency is also at risk if it is unable to operate profitably. I suspect that the definition of solvency varies among people in the same country and from country to country. You should check the legal system in your country to find the appropriate meaning.",
    "Definition of Leverage": "In accounting and finance, leverage is the use of a significant amount of debt to purchase an asset, operate a company, acquire another company, etc. Since the cost of debt is normally less than the cost of obtaining additional stockholders’ equity, it is wise for a company to use some debt to control a larger amount of profitable assets. However, too much debt can mean significant risk when business conditions decline. Leverage is also known as trading on equity.",
    "Examples of Leverage": "A company’s leverage can be measured by the following financial ratios:",
    "Example of a Reduction in Accumulated Depreciation": "Assume that a company has lots of equipment with a total cost of $600,000 that is reported in the asset account Equipment. The company’s total amount of accumulated depreciation is $380,000 which appears as a credit balance in the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation. Now assume that the company sells one piece of equipment that had a cost of $50,000 and had accumulated depreciation of $40,000 at the end of the previous accounting year. The first step is to record this year’s depreciation for the equipment being sold. Let’s assume the depreciation from the end of the previous accounting year until the date of the sale is $500. Therefore, the credit balance for this one piece of equipment at the time of the sale is $40,500. If the company receives $5,000 when disposing of the equipment, the journal entry to record the sale is:",
    "Definition of Effective Interest Rate of a Bond": "The effective interest rate of a bond is usually the market interest rate and the bond’s yield-to-maturity (as opposed to the interest rated stated on the face of the bond).  The effective interest rate of a bond is the rate that will discount both the bond’s future interest payments and the bond’s maturity value to a present value that is equal to the bond’s current market value. If the market interest rate increases, the present value (and the market value) of the bond will decrease. If the market interest rate decreases, the present value (and the market value) of the bond will increase. ",
    "Example of Effective Interest Rate of a Bond": "Assume that an investor wants to purchase an existing bond. One bond that is available has a face/maturity value of $100,000 and has a stated interest rate of 5% and will mature in 3 years. The cash that the investor will be receiving is $2,500 every six months ($100,000 X 5% X 1/2 year) for 3 years and then $100,000 at the end of 3 years. The bond’s current price is $83,748. At this price, the investor will earn an effective interest rate (or a yield to maturity) of 6% as shown here: The present value of the cash from a 5% $100,000 bond maturing in 3 years and trading in a 6% market is as follows:",
    "Land, Buildings and Machinery are Fixed Assets": "It is common for people to refer to land, buildings, and machinery as fixed assets. They are also referred to as plant assets and are reported on a company’s balance sheet under the heading of property, plant, and equipment.",
    "Depreciation of the Building and Equipment is a Fixed Cost": "The depreciation expense associated with a company’s buildings and machinery is considered to be a fixed cost or a fixed expense. The property insurance expense associated with these assets is also a fixed cost or fixed expense. Fixed expenses such as depreciation expense and property insurance expense are reported on a company’s income statement. Understanding which costs are fixed and which are variable is important for determining a company’s break-even point.",
    "Example of Absorption Costing Causing an Increase in Net Income": "Assume a company has no beginning inventory and it plans to manufacture 100,000 units. Also assume that its annual fixed manufacturing overhead costs are $600,000. If 100,000 units are manufactured, the fixed manufacturing overhead cost per unit will be $6 ($600,000 divided by 100,000 units). If the 100,000 units are sold for $20 each, the income statement will report sales revenues of $2,000,000 and its cost of goods sold will include $600,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead. Now let’s assume that the fixed manufacturing overhead costs remain at $600,000 but the company decides to manufacture 120,000 units (even though sales are expected to be only 100,000 units). In this situation, the fixed manufacturing overhead cost per unit will be applied at a rate of $5 per unit ($600,000/120,000 units manufactured). Since the sales remain at $2,000,000 (100,000 units X $20) but the cost of goods sold will include only $500,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead costs (100,000 units sold X $5), the gross profit will be $100,000 larger. The reason for the additional $100,000 in gross profit is that each of the additional 20,000 units in inventory have absorbed (been assigned) $5 of fixed manufacturing overhead costs.",
    "Definition of Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio": "The fixed asset turnover ratio shows the relationship between a company’s annual net sales and the net amount of its fixed assets. The net amount of fixed assets is the amount reported on the company’s balance sheet as property, plant and equipment (PPE) after deducting accumulated depreciation. Since net sales occurred throughout the year,  you should divide the net sales by the average amount of net PPE during the year of the net sales.",
    "Example of Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio": "Assume that during its recent year a corporation had net sales of $18 million. Its average amount of net property, plant and equipment (after deducting accumulated depreciation) was $6 million. Based on the information given, the corporation’s fixed asset turnover was 3 times ($18 million of net sales divided by $6 million of average net property, plant and equipment).",
    "Example of a Decrease in Accumulated Depreciation": "Assume that a company purchased new equipment 5 years ago at a cost of $210,000. The asset had a useful life of 7 years and no salvage value. As a result, each year the company debited Deprecation Expense for $30,000 and credited Accumulated Depreciation for $30,000. Therefore, after 5 years, the Equipment account has the cost of $210,000 and the Accumulated Depreciation account has a credit balance of $150,000. (Therefore, the asset’s book value or carrying value is $60,000.) On the next day, the company sells the equipment for $32,000. The necessary entry will:",
    "Examples of a Corporation’s Retained Earnings in Relation to Its Dividends": "When a corporation’s board of directors must decide on the amount of dividends to declare and distribute to its stockholders, the following corporation information should be considered:",
    "Definition of Return on Assets Ratio": "The return on assets ratio, or return on total assets ratio, relates a company’s net income during a specific year, to the company’s average total assets during the same year. The return on assets ratio for a regular corporation can be computed using the before tax earnings and/or the after tax earnings. ",
    "Example of Return on Assets Ratio": "Assume that during its most recent year, a company’s income statement reported net income of $60,000. During the same period, the company’s 12 monthly balance sheets reported an average of $1,000,000 in total assets. The company’s return on assets ratio for the year was 6% ($60,000 divided by $1,000,000). This company’s return on assets can be compared to other companies in the same industry.",
    "Definition of Total Asset Turnover Ratio": "The total asset turnover ratio indicates the relationship between a company’s net sales for a specified year to the average amount of total assets during the same 12 months.",
    "Example of Total Asset Turnover Ratio": "Assume that during a recent year a company’s income statement reported net sales of $2,100,000. During the same period, the company’s total assets reported on its 12 monthly balance sheets averaged $1,400,000. The company’s total asset turnover for the year was 1.5 (net sales of $2,100,000 divided by $1,400,000 of average total assets). This ratio will vary by industry, as some industries are more capital intensive than others. Always compare your company’s financial ratios to the ratios of other companies in the same industry.",
    "Difference Between Periodic LIFO and Perpetual LIFO": "The difference between periodic LIFO and perpetual LIFO involves the time at which the latest inventory costs are removed from the inventory account:",
    "Example of Difference Between Periodic LIFO and Perpetual LIFO": "Assume that a company’s accounting year is January 1 through December 31 and the company sells only one type of product. In its beginning inventory are 2 units with a cost of $10 each. The company sells 1 unit on March 1. On April 1, the company purchases 5 units at a cost of $11 each. On September 1, the company sells 3 units. In summary, the company had 2 units on January 1, purchased 5 units on April 1, sold 4 units during the year, and has 3 units on hand at December 31. With periodic LIFO the costs of the latest purchases starting with the end of the year are removed first. Since 4 units were sold during the year, the costs removed from inventory and charged to the cost of goods sold will be the last cost of 4 units, which is $11 each. This means the cost of its December 31 inventory using periodic LIFO will be $31 (1 unit at $11 plus 2 units at $10). With perpetual LIFO the costs of the latest purchases as of the date of each sale are removed first. On March 1, the latest cost at that time for the 1 unit sold was $10. At the time of the sale on September 1, the latest cost of the 3 units sold was $11 each. Using perpetual LIFO, the company’s cost of goods sold will be $43 (1 at $10 and 3 at $11), and its inventory will be reported at a cost of $32 (2 units at $11 and 1 unit at $10).",
    "Definition of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income": "Accumulated other comprehensive income is a separate line within the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet. The amount reported is the net cumulative amount of the items that have been reported as other comprehensive income on each period’s statement of comprehensive income.  It is similar to the amount of retained earnings which is the net cumulative amount of the items reported on each period’s income statement. ",
    "Examples of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income": "Some items that make up the amount of accumulated other comprehensive income include the following:",
    "Example of Net Working Capital": "As an example, a company with current assets of $130,000 and current liabilities of $100,000 has $30,000 of net working capital. This amount may be sufficient for some companies but inadequate for other companies.",
    "Difference Between Net Working Capital and Liquidity": "Net working capital is often cited as one of the indicators of a company’s liquidity. However, the amount of net working capital alone does not assure a company of the liquidity necessary to pay its current liabilities when they come due. For example, if a company’s current assets consist mainly of slow-moving inventory and some slow-paying accounts receivable, the company may not be able to convert its current assets to a sufficient amount of cash in time to pay its obligations. Not having sufficient cash to pay employees, suppliers and other creditors may lead to serious problems. In contrast, another company that sells fast-moving products online with customers paying with credit cards will have liquidity even with a small amount of net working capital. If this company’s suppliers also have credit terms of net 60 days or the company pays its bills by using its business credit card, the company may be able to operate with negative working capital. Managing Working Capital\nIn short, net working capital management is critical for a company’s positive relationships with lenders, suppliers, employees and customers. All of the components of net working capital should be examined in detail and managed properly.",
    "Definition of Periodic Inventory System": "The periodic inventory system does not update the general ledger account Inventory when a company purchases goods to be resold. Rather than debiting Inventory, the company debits the temporary account Purchases. Any adjustments related to these purchases of goods will be credited to a general ledger contra account such as Purchases Discounts or Purchases Returns and Allowances. When the balances of these three purchases accounts are combined, the resulting amount is known as net purchases. When goods are sold under the periodic inventory system there is no entry to credit the Inventory account or to debit the account Cost of Goods Sold. Hence, the Inventory account contains only the ending balance from the previous year. As a result, the company must compute an inventory amount at the end of each accounting period in order to report the amount of its ending inventory for its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold for its income statement.",
    "Computing the Inventory Amount Under the Periodic Inventory Method": "At the end of an accounting year, the company’s ending inventory is normally computed based on a physical count of its inventory items. However, the inventory amounts for the monthly and quarterly financial statements are usually estimates. Under the periodic inventory system the cost of goods sold is computed as follows: beginning inventory (previous year’s ending inventory cost) + net purchases = cost of goods available – costs computed for the ending inventory = cost of goods sold. An alternative format is: net purchases plus the decrease in inventory or minus the increase in inventory = cost of goods sold.",
    "Inventory Records Outside of the General Ledger": "It should be noted that companies using the periodic inventory system in their general ledger accounts often have sophisticated inventory systems outside of the general ledger for tracking the items it purchases, produces, sells and has on hand.",
    "Example and Limitations of the Inventory Turnover Ratio": "As an example, assume that in its recent year a company had sales of $7 million, cost of goods sold (COGS) of $5 million, and an average inventory cost of $1 million. This means the company’s inventory turnover was on average 5 (or 5 times) calculated by dividing the COGS of $5 million of cost of goods sold by $1 million of inventory cost. (This indicates that on average the company turned its inventory every 72 days.) A limitation of the inventory turnover is that it is an average, which means that some important details may be hidden. For instance, what if four inventory items make up 40% of the company’s sales but make up only 10% of the inventory cost? These fast selling items will have a turnover ratio of 20 (40% of the COGS = $2 million divided by $100,000, which is 10% of $1 million). This means that the remaining items in inventory will have a cost of goods sold of $3,000,000 and their average inventory cost will be $900,000. As a result, the majority of the items in inventory will have an average turnover ratio of 3.3 ($3,000,000 divided by $900,000). In other words, the fast selling items are turning every 18 days (365 days/20) and the majority of the items are turning on average every 109 days (365/3.3). That information is being hidden when the focus is on the average of 72 days. It is also likely there is another group of inventory items that are turning even less than 3.3 times during the year. People within the company can overcome the shortcomings described above by computing the inventory turnover ratio and the days’ sales in inventory for each and every item in inventory. By reviewing the turnover ratio for each item, the slow moving items cannot be hidden by the overall turnover ratio.",
    "Examples of Reasons for Retained Earnings": "The following are some examples of the reasons for a corporation to not distribute its retained earnings as cash dividends to its stockholders:",
    "Physically Counting the Items in Inventory": "One method for calculating the cost of a company’s ending inventory is to 1) physically count the quantity of each of the items in inventory and then 2) multiply those quantities by each item’s actual unit cost. The actual unit costs must be consistent with the cost flow assumption (FIFO, weighted-average, etc.) that was elected by the company. Special attention is required for items that are on consignment or are in transit. Taking the physical counts can be very time consuming and complicated especially when inventory items are moving between operations. As a result, large companies are likely to physically count the inventory items only at the end of the accounting year.",
    "Using the Quantities in the Company’s Inventory System": "A second method which can be used for interim financial statements is to calculate the ending inventory by using the quantities on the company’s inventory system. Those quantities are multiplied by the actual unit costs that reflect the company’s cost flow assumption. (Throughout the year the inventory system’s quantities should be adjusted to agree with any physical counts. Some companies will physically count a different group of inventory items each month and compare those counts to the system’s quantities.)",
    "Estimating the Cost of the Ending Inventory": "A third approach is to use the gross profit method to calculate the estimated cost of the ending inventories that will be used on the interim financial statements.",
    "Definition of Liquidation": "Liquidation is a term commonly used to describe a company selling parts of its business for cash,  selling its assets in order to pay debts, or the process of winding down or closing a business.",
    "Example of Accelerated Depreciation": "Assume a corporation acquires equipment with a cost of $600,000 that will be used in its business for 10 years (120 months) and have no salvage value at the end of 10 years. On its monthly financial statements, the corporation will likely report Depreciation Expense of $5,000 for 120 months. However, on its U.S. income tax return, the corporation is allowed to depreciate the asset over 7 years at an accelerated rate. Often the income tax regulations (See IRS.gov) allow special depreciation in which the equipment will be expensed sooner or even immediately. This could result in a significant reduction in the amount of income taxes to be paid in the early years of an asset’s life, which in turn reduces the time required for the corporation to recover the amount it paid for the equipment.",
    "Definition of Quick Assets": "Quick assets are a company’s current assets which can quickly be converted into cash. Quick assets provide the liquidity necessary to pay the company’s obligations when they come due. The total of a company’s quick assets is compared to the total of its current liabilities in the calculation of the company’s quick ratio.",
    "Examples of Quick Assets": "Common examples of quick assets include:",
    "Definition of Depreciable Asset": "A depreciable asset has the following characteristics:",
    "Examples of Depreciable Assets": "Some examples of depreciable assets include the following:",
    "Definition of Gross Margin Ratio": "The gross margin ratio is a percentage resulting from dividing the amount of a company’s gross profit by the amount of its net sales. (The gross margin ratio is also known as the gross profit margin or the gross profit percentage or simply the gross margin.) Companies should be continuously monitoring its gross margin ratio to be certain it is sufficient to cover its selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and to earn a profit.",
    "Example of Gross Margin Ratio": "To illustrate the gross margin ratio, let’s assume that a company has net sales of $800,000 and its cost of goods sold is $600,000. As a result, its gross profit is $200,000 (net sales of $800,000 minus its cost of goods sold of $600,000) and its gross margin ratio is 25% (gross profit of $200,000 divided by net sales of $800,000). Note: Gross margin ratios vary between industries. Therefore, you should compare a company’s gross margin ratio to other companies in the same industry and to its own past ratios or its planned ratios.",
    "Calculation of the Cost of Goods Sold for a Manufacturer": "The calculation of the cost of goods sold for a manufacturing company is:",
    "Definition of Contribution Margin": "In accounting, contribution margin is defined as: revenues minus variable expenses. The contribution margin can be expressed as an amount and/or as a ratio or percent of revenues. The contribution margin tells us how much of the revenues will be available (after the variable expenses are covered) for the fixed expenses and net income. The contribution margin amount or ratio (ratio) can be presented for:",
    "Information for Examples": "Let’s assume that a company had the following amounts during the past year:",
    "Example of Gross Margin": "The company’s gross margin is: net sales of $600,000 minus the cost of goods sold of $320,000 = $280,000. The gross margin or gross profit percentage is: gross profit of $280,000 divided by net sales of $600,000 = 46.7%.",
    "Example of Contribution Margin": "Let’s assume that a manufacturer has only one product and 80,000 units were manufactured and sold during a recent year. The selling price was $10 per unit. The variable expenses were $4 per unit (consisting of manufacturing costs of $3 per unit and variable SG&A expenses of $1 per unit). The company’s fixed expenses were $390,000 (consisting of fixed manufacturing costs of $300,000 and fixed SG&A expenses of $90,000). The amount of the company’s contribution margin was $480,000 calculated using the following amounts:",
    "Example of Depreciation Expense": "To illustrate depreciation expense, assume that a company had paid $480,000 for its office building (excluding land) and the building has an estimated useful life of 40 years (480 months) with no salvage value. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, the  depreciation expense to be reported on each of the company’s monthly income statements is $1,000 ($480,000 divided by 480 months).",
    "Additional Information": "The change in the inventory is reported as an adjustment to the company’s net income in the cash from operating activities section of the SCF prepared using the indirect method.",
    "Methods for Computing Depreciation Expense": "Four common methods for computing depreciation include:",
    "Definition of Contra Revenue Account": "A contra revenue account is a revenue account that is expected to have a debit balance (instead of the usual credit balance). In other words, its expected balance is contrary to—or opposite of—the usual credit balance in a revenue account. A contra revenue account allows a company to see the original amount sold and to also see the items that reduced the sales to the amount of net sales. ",
    "Examples of Contra Revenue Accounts": "Two examples of contra revenue accounts are:",
    "What is a contra asset account?": "A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is a credit balance. It is described as “contra” because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.) Learn more about contra asset accounts.",
    "Definition of SG&A": "SG&A is the acronym for selling, general and administrative. SG&A are the operating expenses incurred to 1) promote, sell, and deliver a company’s products and services, and 2) manage the overall company. SG&A will be reported on the income statement in the period in which the expenses occur. Hence, SG&A expenses are said to be period costs as opposed to being part of a product’s cost. Since SG&A expenses are not a product cost, they are not assigned to the cost of goods sold or to the goods that are in inventory. ",
    "Examples of SG&A": "SG&A expenses include sales commissions, advertising, promotional materials, compensation of the company’s officers as well as the marketing, sales, finance and office staffs, rent, utilities, supplies, computers, etc. provided they are outside of the manufacturing operations. SG&A will not include interest expense since interest expense is reported as a nonoperating expense.",
    "Definition of Commissions": "Commissions are compensation for obtaining sales. Hence, sales commissions are a selling expense and will be recorded in general ledger accounts having Sales Commissions Expenses in their title. Sales commissions are considered to be operating expenses and are presented on the income statement as SG&A expenses. (SG&A is the acronym for selling, general and administrative expenses.) Sales commissions are not part of the cost of a product. Therefore, sales commissions are not assigned to the cost of goods held in inventory or to the cost of goods sold.",
    "Definition of Dividend Payments": "The cash dividends paid to stockholders are a distribution of the corporation’s earnings. Dividends are not an expense (or loss) of the corporation, and will not be reported as one of the expenses on the corporation’s income statement.",
    "Examples of Dividend Payments": "The cash dividends on a corporation’s common stock are not reported on the corporation’s income statements as an expense. Cash dividends on a corporation’s preferred stock (if any) are not reported as expenses. However, cash dividends on the preferred stock will appear on the corporation’s income statement as a subtraction from the corporation’s net income. This is necessary to report the earnings available for common stock. When the earnings available for common stock is divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, the resulting earnings per share will appear on the income statement.",
    "Gross Margin Can be an Amount or a Percentage": "Gross margin could be expressed as:",
    "Examples of Gross Margin Calculations": "If a retailer had net sales of $40,000 and its cost of goods sold was $24,000, the retailer had a gross margin of $16,000 or 40% of net sales ($16,000/$40,000). A manufacturer sells a product for $40 and its cost of goods sold (which consists of its manufacturing costs) is $28. Therefore, the product’s gross margin is $12 ($40 minus $28), or 30% of the selling price ($12/$40).",
    "Difference Between Gross Margin and Profit Margin": "Gross margin is the amount or percent before subtracting the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses. Profit margin is the amount or percent after the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses are subtracted. For example, a chain of grocery stores many have a gross margin of 20%, but its profit margin may be 1% (of net sales).",
    "What the Gross Margin Tells You": "Analysts track a company’s gross margin percentage to determine whether the company is able to increase selling prices when costs are increasing or when competitors are reducing prices or expanding their sales efforts. The gross margin of individual products could indicate to management that some products should be promoted more aggressively and some products should be phased out.",
    "Definition of Profit and Loss Statement": "The profit and loss statement, or P&L, is a name sometimes used to describe a company’s income statement, statement of income, statement of operations, or statement of earnings. In short, the profit and loss statement reports a company’s revenues, expenses, and most of the gains and losses which occurred during the period of time shown in the statement’s heading. (A few gains and losses are not reported on the profit and loss statement. Instead, they are reported on the company’s statement of comprehensive income.) The profit and loss statement’s period of time could be a year, a year-to-date period such as nine months, a quarter of a year, one month, four weeks, 52 weeks, etc. Under the accrual basis (or method) of accounting the revenues and expenses reported on the profit and loss statement should be:",
    "Example of Profit and Loss Statement": "The following is an example of the key elements of a profit and loss statement, which officially is known as the income statement. ",
    "Examples of Depreciation Expense Reported as an Administrative Expense": "The depreciation of the following assets will be recorded and reported as administrative expenses:",
    "Definition of Operating Income": "A retailer’s operating income is its sales minus the cost of goods sold and all selling and administrative expenses (fixed and variable). Operating income is also the net income before any nonoperating items such as interest revenue, interest expense, gain or loss on the sale of plant assets, etc.",
    "Example of Operating Income": "Using the amounts from above example, the retailer’s operating income is: sales of $400,000 minus the cost of goods sold of $250,000 minus the fixed and variable selling and administrative expenses of $130,000 = $20,000. The operating income as a percent of sales is 5% ($20,000/$400,000).",
    "Definition of Rent as Overhead": "The rental cost of a building used in manufacturing is part of manufacturing overhead. Manufacturing overhead is assigned or allocated to the units produced. As a result, the units produced include part of the rent of the manufacturing building.  The rental cost of a building that is not used for manufacturing (such as the rent of a manufacturer’s marketing and administrative offices or the rent of a retail store) is not part of the manufacturing overhead. (It might be referred to as administrative overhead.) This rent does not get assigned or allocated to the units produced. Instead, the entire rent of the nonmanufacturing facilities is immediately expensed in the accounting period when the building is rented.",
    "Example of Rent as Overhead": "Assume that a manufacturer rents several buildings at a total cost of $15,000 a month. It has been determined that $10,000 of the rent pertains to the manufacturing facilities. The remaining $5,000 is for rent for housing the nonmanufacturing functions such as selling, general and administration. The $10,000 of manufacturing rent is part of the manufacturing overhead, which is an indirect product cost that must be assigned to units of product manufactured on a logical basis. As a result, part of the rent is included in the units’ costs which are in inventory or have been sold. When a unit of product is sold, the manufacturing rent that is included in the product cost will be part of the cost of goods sold that is reported on the income statement. The remaining $5,000 of rent for nonmanufacturing functions is expensed each month without being allocated to the units produced. Accountants refer to this rent as a period expense (not a product cost).",
    "Definition of Nonoperating Expenses and Losses": "Nonoperating expenses are business expenses that are outside of a company’s main or central operations. (Some describe them as incidental or peripheral.) Losses often involve the disposal of property, plant and equipment for a cash amount that is less than the carrying amount (or book value) of the asset sold. Nonoperating expenses and losses are often reported on the income statement after the subtotal Income from operations and will often appear with the caption Other income and (expenses).",
    "Examples of Nonoperating Expenses and Losses": "A common example on a nonoperating expense is the interest expense incurred by a retailer or manufacturer. The retailer’s main operations are purchasing and selling merchandise. The manufacturer’s main operation are producing and selling its products. Borrowing money is outside of these businesses’ main or central operations. An example of a loss is the retailer’s disposal of one of its delivery trucks for a cash amount that is less than the truck’s carrying amount. Another example is a loss from a settlement of a lawsuit.",
    "Definition of COS": "In accounting, the acronym COS could indicate either cost of sales or cost of services. The income statement of a manufacturer or a retailer might use the term cost of sales or it might use the term cost of goods sold, cost of products sold, or cost of revenue to describe the amount that it is subtracting from its sales revenue to report the amount of its gross profit or gross margin. Companies that provide services will use the term cost of services or cost of service revenues to report the direct costs associated with providing services to its clients/customers. ",
    "Example of COS": "The income statements of companies will not use the acronym COS. Instead, the companies will show the words cost of sales and/or cost of services. For example, the income statements of Apple and Intuit report both cost of products and cost of services.",
    "Depreciation Could Be Either an Operating Expense or a Non-operating Expense": "Depreciation is an operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in an organization’s main operating activities. Depreciation is a non-operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in a peripheral or incidental activity of an organization.",
    "Examples of When Depreciation is an Operating Expense": "Examples of depreciation being reported as part of the operating expenses on the income statement include:",
    "Definition of Dividend": "A dividend declared by a corporation is a distribution to its stockholders of the profits the corporation had earned. Since the dividends are not an expense, the dividends do not reduce the corporation’s net income (earnings, profits). Dividends will reduce the corporation’s retained earnings which is reported in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet. (A cash dividend also reduces the corporation’s current asset Cash.)",
    "Example of Dividend Reporting": "While dividends do not reduce the corporation’s net income reported on the income statement, the dividends do reduce the corporation’s retained earnings and stockholders’ equity. The dividends are reported on the corporation’s statement of stockholders’ equity, one of the required financial statements which summarizes the changes in stockholders’ equity.",
    "Definition of Earnings per Share": "The earnings per share ratio, or simply earnings per share, or EPS, is a corporation’s 1) net income (or earnings) after tax that is available to its common stockholders, divided by 2) the weighted average number of shares of common stock that are outstanding during the period of the earnings. If a corporation had preferred stock outstanding, the required preferred stock’s dividend is shown as a deduction before the earnings that are available for common stockholders. If a U.S. corporation’s shares of common stock are traded on a stock exchange, the earnings per share must appear on the face of its income statement.",
    "Example of Earnings per Share": "Assume a corporation has only one class of common stock outstanding and has no securities that can be converted into shares of common stock. During its most recent year its earnings (net income after income tax expense) were $9,410,000 and it had 900,000 shares of common stock from January 1 through June 30, and 1,100,000 shares from July 1 through December 31. The corporation will report earnings per share of $9.41 ($9,410,000/1,000,000).",
    "Definition of Cost of Goods Available": "For non-manufacturing companies using the periodic inventory system in its general ledger, the cost of goods available (COGA, or cost of goods available for sale) for a year is the sum of the following: the costs in the beginning inventory (the prior year’s ending inventory) + the cost of the current year’s net purchases.",
    "Allocating Cost of Goods Available to Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold": "At the end of the year, the cost of goods available amount must be allocated or divided between:",
    "Major Components of Operating Income": "The operating revenues are often described as net sales, while the operating expenses will include the cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), and perhaps impairment charges. Some of the SG&A expenses may appear as separate amounts such as depreciation and amortization, and research and development.",
    "Main Difference between Direct and Indirect Method of SCF": "The main difference between the direct method and the indirect method of presenting the statement of cash flows (SCF) involves the cash flows from operating activities. (There are no differences in the cash flows from investing activities and/or the cash flows from financing activities.) Under the U.S. reporting rules, a corporation has the option of using either the direct or the indirect method. However, surveys indicate that nearly all large U.S. corporations use the indirect method.",
    "Example of the Indirect Method of SCF": "When the indirect method of presenting a corporation’s cash flows from operating activities is used, this section of SCF will begin with a corporation’s net income. The net income is then followed by the adjustments needed to convert the accrual accounting net income to the cash flows from operating activities. A few of the typical adjustments are:",
    "Example of the Direct Method of SCF": "When the direct method of presenting a corporation’s cash flows from operating activities is used, the amount of net income is not the starting point. Instead, the direct method lists the cash amounts received and paid by the corporation. Here are a few of the more common descriptions that will be seen under the direct method:",
    "Definition of Financing Activities": "Financing activities reported on the statement of cash flows (SCF) involve changes to the long-term liabilities, stockholders’ equity, and short-term borrowings during the period shown in the heading of SCF.",
    "Examples of Financing Activities": "Sources of cash provided by financing activities include:",
    "Definition of Investing Activities": "Investing activities often refers to the cash flows from investing activities, which is one of the three main sections of the statement of cash flows (or SCF or cash flow statement). In this section of the SCF the company lists its cash inflows and cash outflows resulting from the disposal or acquisition of the company’s long-term assets that took place during the time indicated in the heading of the statement.",
    "Examples of Investing Activities": "When a company makes long-term investments in securities, acquires property, equipment, vehicles, or it expands its facilities, etc., it is assumed to be using or reducing the company’s cash and cash equivalents. As a result, these investments and capital expenditures are reported as negative amounts in the cash flows from investing activities  section of the SCF. When a company sells any of its long-term investments or sells any of its property, plant and equipment, it is assumed to be providing or increasing the company’s cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, the cash received from the sale of these long-term assets will be reported as positive amounts in the cash flows from investing activities section of the SCF.",
    "Example of Interest Expense on the Cash Flow Statement": "Since most companies use the indirect method of preparing the cash flow statement (or statement of cash flows), the company’s  interest expense will be contained within the company’s net income, which is the first amount presented in the cash flows from operating activities. The interest expense contained in the net income will be changed from the accrual amount to the cash amount by the change in the current liability Interest Payable.  Since interest expense is an important amount, the statement of cash flows must disclose the amount of interest paid. This is often achieved through a supplementary disclosure.",
    "Meaning of a Negative Amount on Statement of Cash Flows": "A negative amount on the statement of cash flows (SCF) indicates that the amount described was:",
    "Example Where Inventory Increased": "An increase in a company’s inventory indicates that the company has purchased more goods than it has sold. Since the purchase of additional inventory requires the use of cash, it means there was an additional outflow of cash. An outflow of cash has a negative or unfavorable effect on the company’s cash balance. Negative effects are reported as negative amounts on the SCF. To recap, an increase in inventory results in a negative amount being reported on the SCF. (A decrease in inventory would be reported as a positive amount, since reducing inventory has a positive effect on the company’s cash balance.)",
    "Definition of Interest on Bank Loans": "The interest on bank loans is usually an expense of the accounting period in which the interest is incurred. Therefore, the interest appears on the income statement and reduces a company’s net income. However, the interest paid also causes a change in the company’s balance sheet and statement of cash flows.  ",
    "Reporting Interest Paid on the Statement of Cash Flows": "In the statement of cash flows, interest paid will be reported in the section entitled cash flows from operating activities.  Since most companies use the indirect method for the statement of cash flows, the interest expense will be “buried” in the corporation’s net income. Net income will be the first item listed in the section cash flows from operating activities and will then be adjusted to the cash amount. The amount of interest paid must also be disclosed. This is usually done as supplementary information at the end of the statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements.",
    "Definition of Long-term Assets": "Long-term assets, which are also referred to as noncurrent assets, are assets that generally are not expected to be converted to cash within one year of the balance sheet date.\nExamples of Long-term Assets\nLong-term assets include long-term investments in financial securities, property, plant, equipment, and intangible assets.\nDefinition of Proceeds from Long-term Assets\nThe money a company receives when selling one of its long-term assets is referred to as the  proceeds. \nDefinition of Gain on Sale of Long-term Assets\nWhen a company sells one of its long-term assets and the amount of the proceeds is greater than the book value or carrying value of the long-term asset at the time of the sale, the difference is a gain on the sale or disposal.  (If the amount received is less than the book value, the difference is a loss on the sale or disposal.) \nTo have the book value at the time of the sale, the asset’s depreciation must be recorded up to the date of the sale.\nExample of Proceeds and Gain on Sale of Long-term Asset\nAssume that a company sells one of its company cars for $10,000. After recording the depreciation to the date of the sale, the car’s book value is $6,000 (cost of $28,000 minus accumulated depreciation of $22,000).\nThe company will have proceeds of $10,000 and a gain on the sale of $4,000 ($10,000 minus the book value of $6,000).\nOn the statement of cash flows, the proceeds from the sale of a long-term asset is reported as a positive amount in the investing activities section. Since the gain on the sale is included in the net income, the gain is shown as a deduction from the net income reported in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement (under the indirect method). \n",
    "Definition of Proceeds from Long-term Assets": "The money a company receives when selling one of its long-term assets is referred to as the  proceeds. ",
    "Definition of Gain on Sale of Long-term Assets": "When a company sells one of its long-term assets and the amount of the proceeds is greater than the book value or carrying value of the long-term asset at the time of the sale, the difference is a gain on the sale or disposal.  (If the amount received is less than the book value, the difference is a loss on the sale or disposal.)  To have the book value at the time of the sale, the asset’s depreciation must be recorded up to the date of the sale.",
    "Example of Proceeds and Gain on Sale of Long-term Asset": "Assume that a company sells one of its company cars for $10,000. After recording the depreciation to the date of the sale, the car’s book value is $6,000 (cost of $28,000 minus accumulated depreciation of $22,000). The company will have proceeds of $10,000 and a gain on the sale of $4,000 ($10,000 minus the book value of $6,000). On the statement of cash flows, the proceeds from the sale of a long-term asset is reported as a positive amount in the investing activities section. Since the gain on the sale is included in the net income, the gain is shown as a deduction from the net income reported in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement (under the indirect method). ",
    "Definition of Short-Term Bank Loans": "Short-term bank loans are generally loans that must be repaid within one year of the date of the balance sheet. In other words, a short-term bank loan is a current liability.",
    "Reporting Short-Term Bank Loans on the Statement of Cash Flows": "The cash inflows received through short-term bank loans and the cash outflows used to repay the principal amount of short-term bank loans are reported in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. The interest paid on short-term bank loans is included in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows.",
    "Definition of Interest on a Note Payable": "The interest on a note payable is reported on the income statement as Interest Expense. Usually this means the amount incurred (not the amount paid) under the accrual basis of accounting.",
    "Reporting Interest on a Note Payable on the Cash Flow Statement": "The interest paid on a note payable is reported in the section of the cash flow statement entitled cash flows from operating activities. Since most corporations report the cash flows from operating activities by using the indirect method, the interest expense will be included in the company’s net income or net earnings. The interest expense is adjusted to a cash amount through the changes to the working capital amounts, which are also reported as part of the cash flows from operating activities. In addition, the actual amount of interest paid must be disclosed. If a corporation prepares its cash flow statement using the direct method, the amount of interest paid should appear as a separate line in cash flows from operating activities. [The cash payments and cash receipts of principal  on a note payable are reported in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement.]",
    "Definition of Net Loss": "A net loss occurs when a company’s revenues and gains are less than its operating expenses, other expenses and losses. The net loss or net income is reported on the company’s income statement. Keep in mind that under the accrual basis of accounting:",
    "Definition of Positive Cash Flow": "Generally, a positive cash flow refers to a positive net inflow of cash from operating activities, which is shown on a company’s statement of cash flows (SCF) or cash flow statement. [The SCF should be distributed with a company’s income statement and balance sheet.] The cash from operating activities almost always begins with the company’s accrual accounting net income or net loss for the accounting period. The net income or net loss amount is then adjusted to the cash amount. It is in this section of the SCF where you will find the reasons why a company can have an accounting net loss but have a positive net cash inflow.",
    "Example of Net Loss But a Positive Cash Flow": "A common adjustment to a company’s accrual accounting net income or net loss is depreciation expense. Depreciation expense was included on the income statement and reduced the company’s net income (or increased its net loss), but the depreciation amount did not involve a current period cash payment. For example, if a company purchased equipment in the previous year for $2,100,000 and is depreciating the equipment over seven years, the depreciation expense for the year of the income statement might be $300,000. The $300,000 accounting entry debited Depreciation Expense and credited Accumulated Depreciation. As you can see, not a penny left the checking account in the year of the income statement. (All $2,100,000 of cash left the checking account in the previous year.) If the company’s income statement reported a loss of $50,000 after the $300,000 “non-cash” depreciation expense, the company’s cash may have actually increased by $250,000. There are many other SCF adjustments to the company’s net income that are less significant than depreciation, such as:",
    "Adjustments from Accrual to Cash on Statement of Cash Flows": "When the statement of cash flows (SCF, cash flow statement) is prepared using the indirect method, it begins with the company’s net income for the accounting period. If the income statement was prepared using the accrual method of accounting, the  net income must be adjusted for",
    "Accounts Payable Increases Means Cash Not Spent": "If the balance in a company’s Accounts Payable account has increased, accountants will assume that the company did not pay for all of the expenses that were included in the current period’s income statement. As a result, the company’s cash balance should have increased by more than the reported amount of net income.",
    "SCF Adjustment for an Increase in Accounts Payable": "To illustrate, assume that the income statement reports $20,000 of revenues, $15,000 of expenses, and the resulting net income of $5,000. If the company’s accounts payable had increased by $900, the company must not have paid for $900 of the expenses reported on the income statement. Therefore, the company’s cash balance would increase by $5,900. Expressed differently, the revenues of $20,000 minus the $14,100 of cash paid for expenses ($15,000 minus the $900 of expenses not yet paid) means an increase in cash of $5,900. Hence, the positive adjustment of $900 converts the accrual accounting net income of $5,000 to be the cash amount of $5,900.",
    "An Increase in Accounts Payable is Favorable for a Company’s Cash Balance": "It may help to view the positive amounts on the SCF as being favorable or good for a company’s cash balance. An increase in accounts payable is a positive adjustment because not paying those bills (which were included in the expenses on the income statement) is good for a company’s cash balance.",
    "Definition of Cash Flow": "Cash flow refers to the amounts of cash that a company, investment or project generates. The cash that a company generates is different from the company’s net income (which is measured using the company’s revenues and expenses under the accrual basis of accounting). A company’s significant cash flows are reported in the statement of cash flows, which is organized as follows:",
    "Definition of Free Cash Flow": "Free cash flow for a year is an amount (as opposed to a ratio or percentage) usually defined as: net cash provided by operating activities for the year minus the amount of capital expenditures for the year. Both amounts are taken from a company’s cash flow statement (or statement of cash flows).  A variation of the above calculation is to also subtract the dividends to stockholders, if the dividends are viewed as a requirement.",
    "Example of Free Cash Flow": "Assume that a company’s cash flow statement’s first section reports that the company’s net cash provided by operating activities was $325,000. In the second section of the cash flow statement (Cash Flow from Investing Activities) there is likely a line item Capital expenditures ($210,000). The amount is reported in parentheses to indicate that it is an outflow or use of cash. The above amounts indicate that the company’s free cash flow for the year was $115,000 ($325,000 – $210,000). [The amount of dividends paid during the year is reported as a line item within the third section of the cash flow statement, Cash Flows from Financing Activities.]",
    "Definition of Capex": "Capex is a shortened form of the term capital expenditure or capital expenditures. Capex is often used when referring one or both of the following:",
    "Examples of Capex": "A few examples of items that may be included in capex are:",
    "Definition of Payback Period": "The payback period is a common (but not the best) tool for screening a company’s potential investments. It uses the potential investment’s undiscounted cash flows to calculate the number of years it will take for the company to recoup its investment.",
    "Examples of Payback Periods": "Let’s assume that a company invests cash of $400,000 in more efficient equipment. The cash savings from the new equipment is expected to be $100,000 per year for 10 years. The payback period is expected to be 4 years ($400,000 divided by $100,000 per year). A second project requires a cash investment of $200,000 and it generates cash as follows:",
    "Definition of Markup": "Markup in dollars is the difference between a product’s cost and its selling price. [Note: some retailers may use the term markup to mean an additional markup from an earlier selling price.] The markup is also expressed as a percentage of cost (not selling price).",
    "Example of Markup": "Assume that a product has a cost of $8 and the seller sets a selling price of $10. In dollars, the markup is $2 (the same as the $2 gross profit). However, the markup is usually expressed as a percentage of the product’s cost (not its selling price). Therefore, the $2 markup divided by the product’s cost of $8 results in a markup that is 25% of cost. Thus, if a retailer wants its income statement to show a gross profit that is 20% of sales, the retailer must mark up its products’ costs by 25%.",
    "Definition of Average Collection Period": "The average collection period is the average number of days between 1) the dates that credit sales were made, and 2) the dates that the money was received/collected from the customers. The average collection period is also referred to as the days’ sales in accounts receivable.",
    "Formula for Calculating the Average Collection Period": "One formula for calculating the average collection period is: 365 days in a year divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio. An alternate formula for calculating the average collection period is: the average accounts receivable balance divided by the  average credit sales per day.",
    "Example of Average Collection Period": "Assume that a company had on average $40,000 of accounts receivable during the most recent year. During that year the company had credit sales of $400,000. One calculation of the average collection period is to first determine the accounts receivable turnover ratio,  which is $400,0000 divided by $40,000 = 10 times per year. Since there were 365 days during the recent year, the average collection period is 365 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10 = 36.5 days. Using the alternate formula we first determine the average credit sales per day, which is the $400,000 of credit sales divided by 365 days = $1,096. Next, the average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 is divided by the average credit sales per day of $1,096, which also results in 36.5 days. The monitoring of the average collection period is one way to track a company’s ability to collect its accounts receivable.",
    "Definition of Pro Forma Financial Statement": "A pro forma financial statement is one based on certain assumptions and projections (as opposed to the typical financial statement based on actual past transactions).",
    "Example of Pro Forma Financial Statement": "A corporation may want to see the effects of three possible financing options. Therefore, it prepares a projected balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows for each of the three financing options. These projected financial statements are referred to as pro forma financial statements.",
    "Definition of Accounting Ratios": "Accounting ratios, which are also known as financial ratios, are one part of financial statement analysis. Accounting ratios will often relate one financial statement amount to another financial statement amount. For instance, the inventory turnover ratio divides a company’s cost of goods sold for a recent year by the company’s average inventory during that year. Perhaps the most frequently used accounting ratio is the current ratio, which divides a company’s current assets by its current liabilities. A company’s accounting ratios can be compared to the ratios of other companies in the same industry. An accounting ratio can also be compared to the company’s same ratio in recent periods to see whether the company is improving or declining. ",
    "Examples of Accounting Ratios": "In addition to the inventory turnover ratio and the current ratio, here are some additional accounting/financial ratios:",
    "Definition of Times Interest Earned Ratio": "The times interest earned ratio is an indicator of a corporation’s ability to meet the interest payments on its debt. The times interest earned ratio is calculated as follows: the corporation’s income before interest expense and income tax expense divided by its interest expense. The larger the times interest earned ratio, the more likely that the corporation can make its interest payments. The times interest earned ratio is also referred to as the interest coverage ratio.",
    "Example of Times Interest Earned Ratio": "Assume that a corporation had the following amounts for the most recent year:",
    "Definition of Trading on Equity": "Trading on equity, which is also referred to as financial leverage, occurs when a corporation uses bonds, other debt, and preferred stock to increase its earnings on its common stock. ",
    "Example of Trading on Equity": "To illustrate trading on equity, let’s assume that a corporation uses long term debt to purchase assets that are expected to earn more than the interest on the debt. The earnings in excess of the interest expense on the new debt will increase the earnings of the corporation’s common stockholders. The increase in earnings indicates that the corporation was successful in trading on equity. If the newly purchased assets earn less than the interest expense on the new debt, the earnings of the common stockholders will decrease. There is a limit to the proportion of debt that can be added before the corporation’s financial future is jeopardized. ",
    "Definition of Turnover Ratios": "In accounting, turnover ratios are the financial ratios in which an annual income statement amount is divided by an average asset amount for the same year. Generally, the larger the turnover the better.  The turnover ratios indicate the efficiency or effectiveness of a company’s management. ",
    "Examples of Turnover Ratios": "Some of the turnover ratios are:",
    "Definition of Inventory Days": "I assume that inventory days is referring to the days’ sales in inventory. If so, then inventory days is also related to the inventory turnover ratio. For instance, when the inventory turnover is low, the days’ sales in inventory will be high. When the inventory turnover is high, the days’ sales in inventory will be low.",
    "Examples or Reasons for High Inventory Days": "Assume that a company maintains a constant quantity of items in inventory. If economic or competitive factors cause a sudden and significant drop in sales, the inventory days or days’ sales in inventory will increase. Next, let’s assume that a retailer increases its inventory quantities for some new products and for some special promotions of existing products. If the sales do not increase, the inventory days or days’ sales in inventory will increase.",
    "Definition of Trend Analysis": "In the analysis of financial information, trend analysis is the presentation of amounts from several years all expressed as a percentage of a base year. Trend analysis conveniently shows the reader certain key amounts for 5 or more consecutive years all expressed in easier to absorb amounts. ",
    "Example of Trend Analysis": "Assume you want to see the trend of a service company’s revenues, net income, and number of clients during the years 2017 through 2023. With trend analysis you can easily see how these three amounts have changed over the past six years especially in relation to each other. To illustrate, we will designate 2017 to be the base year and the 2017 amounts will be restated to be 100. The amounts for the years 2018 through 2023 will be presented as the percentages of the 2017 amounts. In other words, each year’s amounts will be divided by the 2017 amounts and the resulting percentage will be presented.  To begin, assume that the revenues for the years 2017 through 2023 were $31,691,000; $40,930,000; $50,704,000; $63,891,000; $79,341,000; $101,154,000; $120,200,000. In relation to the base year, the revenues are restated to: 100, 129, 160, 202, 250, 319, and 379.  Next, assume the net income amounts were divided by the 2017 net income. In relation to the base year, the net income amounts are 100, 147, 206, 253, 343, 467, and 423. Lastly, after the number of clients were divided by the base year number, the amounts as a percent of the base year amounts are: 100, 122, 149, 184, 229, 277, and 317.  From this trend analysis we see that",
    "Definition of Inventory Turnover": "A company’s inventory turnover is often expressed as the company’s cost of goods sold for a year divided by the average cost of inventory during the same year. The result of this calculation is the inventory turnover ratio.",
    "Examples of Inventory Turnover": "If a company’s cost of goods sold for the most recent year was $600,000 and its inventory during that year was $150,000 the inventory turnover was 4 times. This mean the inventory on average was converted to cash four times during the year. If the cost of goods sold was $300,000 and the average inventory was $150,000 the inventory on average turned to cash only 2 times during the year. When inventory items are slow to be converted into cash, the company’s money is sitting in goods instead of in the company’s checking account where it can be used to pay suppliers, employees, lenders, and others. Monitoring the inventory levels (total amount and individual items) may result in:",
    "Definition of Interest Coverage Ratio": "The interest coverage ratio is a financial ratio used as an indicator of a company’s ability to pay the interest on its debt. (The required principal payments are not included in the calculation.) The interest coverage ratio is also known as the times interest earned ratio. The interest coverage ratio is computed by dividing 1) a corporation’s annual income before interest and income tax expenses, by 2) its annual interest expense. A large interest coverage ratio indicates that a corporation will be able to pay the interest on its debt even if its earnings were to decrease. A small interest coverage ratio sends a caution signal.",
    "Example of Interest Coverage Ratio": "Assume a corporation’s most recent annual income statement reported the following:",
    "Example of Payback Period": "Assume a company invests $100,000 in a project that is expected to have the following positive net cash inflows:",
    "Limitations of Payback Period": "The payback period has two limitations or drawbacks:",
    "Example of Limitations of Payback Period": "Assume a corporation is considering investing in one of two projects:",
    "Definition of Bonds and Stock": "In this context, bonds refers to bonds payable, a form of long-term debt that typically promises to pay interest every six months and the principal amount at a specified maturity date. The interest expense associated with bonds payable is deductible from a U.S. corporation’s taxable income. In other words, a profitable corporation will save paying income tax on the amount of the interest expense. The amount of the income tax savings depends on the amount of the interest expense and the corporation’s federal and state incremental income tax rates. In this context, stock usually refers to shares of common stock, which is evidence of an ownership interest in a corporation. Corporations decide whether it will distribute some of its earnings in the form of dividends to its stockholders. Dividends are not an expense and therefore do not reduce the corporation’s net income or its taxable income.",
    "Example of Tax Advantage of Bonds Instead of Stock": "If a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds having an interest rate of 8%, its annual interest expense will be $800,000. When the $800,000 of interest expense is entered on the corporation’s income tax return, its taxable income will decrease by $800,000. If the corporation’s combined federal and state income tax rate on this increment is 40%, the corporation will save paying income taxes of $320,000 ($800,000 of less taxable income X 40%). If the corporation’s income tax rate on this increment is 30%, the corporation will save paying income taxes of $240,000 ($800,000 X 30%). Due to the income tax savings, the net cost of the borrowed money is reduced. In the above example in which the corporation had an incremental tax rate of 40%, its net cost of the borrowed money is $480,000 ($800,000 of interest minus $320,000 of income tax savings) or 4.8% ($480,000/$10,000,000). For a corporation with a combined tax rate of 30%, the net cost of the borrowed money will be $560,000 or 5.6% ($560,000/$10,000,000).",
    "Definition of ROI": "ROI is the acronym for return on investment. Traditionally, ROI related 1) the income statement profit to the 2) the balance sheet investment. A drawback of ROI is that the accounting amounts (revenues, expenses, asset book values, etc.) ignore the time value of money.",
    "Examples of ROI": "In the past, ROI was helpful for monitoring the decentralized divisions of large diverse corporations. The ROI calculation meant dividing division’s operating income by the average amount of operating assets being utilized by the division. For instance, if one of a corporation’s divisions reported operating income of $1 million and it had $10 million of operating assets, its ROI was 10%. In recent times, it’s common to see ROI being used in the context of internet marketing and/or the adoption of wellness programs at large companies. In these situations, the income statement benefits (more sales, lower health insurance expense) are related to the amounts being spent. Here, too, the ROI calculations do not consider the time value of money.",
    "Definition of Return on Stockholders’ Equity": "The financial ratio return on stockholders’ equity (or return on equity) is calculated by dividing a corporation’s net income after income taxes by the average amount  of stockholders’ equity during the period of the net income.",
    "Example of Return on Stockholders’ Equity": "Assume that a corporation without preferred stock had net income after tax of $100,000 for its most recent year. The corporation’s stockholders? equity was $950,000 at the beginning of the year and was $1,050,000 at the end of the year and the increase occurred at a uniform rate throughout the year. The corporation’s return on stockholders? equity was 10% ($100,000 divided by the average stockholders? equity of $1,000,000).",
    "What is a Bank Reconciliation": "A bank reconciliation is a process performed by a company to ensure that its records (check register, general ledger account, balance sheet, etc.) are correct. This is done by comparing the company’s recorded amounts with the amounts shown on the bank statement. Any differences must be justified. When there are no unexplained differences, accountants state that the bank statement has been reconciled. The bank reconciliation is an important part of a company’s internal controls over its assets. To be effective, it should be done by someone other than an authorized check signer and/or record keeper.",
    "Example of a Bank Reconciliation": "Let’s assume that a new company opens its first checking account on June 4 with a deposit of $10,000. During the month of June the company wrote five checks with a total of $5,000. It also made a $2,000 deposit in the bank’s night depository after banking hours on June 30. As a result, the company’s Cash account (in its general ledger and referred to as the “books”) as of June 30 shows a positive, debit balance of $7,000. The bank statement shows a June 30 balance of $5,975. Note that this balance is different from the company’s general ledger’s Cash account balance of $7,000. Generally, neither balance is the correct amount of cash that should be reported on the company’s balance sheet. To reconcile the company’s balance and the bank’s balance requires comparing the details. To illustrate, let’s assume that:",
    "Definition of Bank Credit Memo": "A bank credit memo is an item on a company’s bank account statement that increases a company’s checking account balance.",
    "Examples of Bank Credit Memo in a Bank Reconciliation": "A few examples of a bank credit memo appearing in a company’s bank account include:",
    "Examples of Bank Debit Memo in a Bank Reconciliation": "Some examples of bank debit memos include:",
    "Definition of Outstanding Check": "An outstanding check is a check that a company has issued and recorded in its general ledger accounts, but the check has not yet cleared the bank account on which it is drawn. This means that the bank balance will be greater than the company’s true amount of cash.",
    "Example of an Outstanding Check in the Bank Reconciliation": "In a bank reconciliation the outstanding checks are a deduction from the bank balance (or balance per the bank statement). If an outstanding check from the previous month did not clear the bank account in the current month, the check will remain on the list of outstanding checks. As a result, the bank reconciliation for the current month will again show the outstanding check amount as a subtraction from the bank statement balance. If an outstanding check of the previous month clears the bank, it means the bank paid the check and the check will appear as a deduction on the statement. Hence, the check is removed from the list of outstanding checks.",
    "Definition of Journal Entries in a Bank Reconciliation": "Journal entries are required in a bank reconciliation when there are adjustments to the balance per books. These adjustments result from items appearing on the bank statement that have not been recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts.",
    "Examples of Journal Entries in a Bank Reconciliation": "Common adjustments to the balance per books include:",
    "Definition of Deposit in Transit": "A company’s deposit in transit is the currency and customers’ checks that have been received and are rightfully reported as cash on the date received, and the amount will not appear on the company’s bank statement until a later date. A deposit in transit is also known as an outstanding deposit. When there is a deposit in transit, the amount should be listed on the company’s bank reconciliation as an addition to the balance per bank.",
    "Example of Deposit in Transit": "To illustrate a deposit in transit, let’s assume that a retailer had sales of $4,600 on Saturday, June 29. The retailer deposits the money in the bank’s night depository on Saturday evening. The retailer’s Cash should be debited for $4,600 on June 29. However, the bank statement will report the $4,600 as a deposit on Monday, July 1, when the bank processes the items from its night depository. When preparing a bank reconciliation as of June 30, the company needs to adjust the balance on the bank statement by adding $4,600 for the deposit in transit. This is done because the $4,600 is rightfully included in the company’s general ledger as of June 29, but the $4,600 is not reported on the bank statement as of June 30.",
    "Journal Entries for Bank Reconciliation": "The items on the bank reconciliation that require a journal entry are the items noted as adjustments to books. These are the items that appear on the bank statement, but are not yet recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts.",
    "Examples of Journal Entries for Bank Reconciliation": "Examples of items requiring a journal entry as the result of the bank reconciliation include:",
    "Bank Reconciliation Adjustments to Bank Balance": "The items that are added to the balance per bank when doing a bank reconciliation include:",
    "Definition of Outstanding Deposit": "An outstanding deposit refers to a company’s receipts (cash, checks from customers, etc.) which have been recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts, but the amount does not yet appear on the bank statement. An outstanding deposit is also known as a deposit in transit.",
    "Example of Outstanding Deposit": "Assume that on October 31, a company received cash and checks from customers in the amount of $800. This $800 should be reported as part of the company’s cash balance as of October 31. However, the company did not deposit the $800 in its bank account until the morning of November 1. Since the $800 is not on the company’s bank statement as of October 31, the $800 is an outstanding deposit or deposit in transit as of October 31. On the company’s October 31 bank reconciliation, the outstanding deposit is shown as an addition to the balance on the October 31 bank statement. (There is no adjustment to the company’s accounts since the $800 had been recorded as of October 31.) To guide you in preparing the bank reconciliation we developed a bank reconciliation template/form which is part of AccountingCoach PRO. You can also read our free Explanation of the Bank Reconciliation.",
    "Definition of Overdraft": "An overdraft (also known as a bank overdraft) generally means that the amount of a company’s checks being presented at the bank for payment exceeded the amount on deposit. If the checks were to be paid by the bank, the bank checking account will have a negative balance. The negative balance in the bank account will likely result in one of the following actions by the bank:",
    "Example of Overdraft": "Assume that on May 27, a company’s checking account has a bank balance and a general ledger account balance of $300. The company, knowing that its checking account will receive an electronic deposit of $1,000 on May 31, decides to writes checks of $100, $250, and $400 and mails them to the payees on May 27. The company expects the checks to clear its bank account after June 1. Unfortunately, the checks for $250 and $400 reach the bank account on May 30, causing the May 30 bank account balance to be a negative $350. If the bank is eager to earn fees, its computer will process the $400 check first, followed by the $250 check. This will cause the company to incur two bank fees for the bank returning the two checks to the endorsers/payees. The company will then have to pay the endorsers/payees the amounts on the checks plus any fees their banks charged for handling the NSF checks. The payees may require the company to pay for future transactions with cash since it displayed a lack of money in the bank.  ",
    "Definition of Voided Check on Bank Reconciliation": "If a check was voided in the current month but was written in the previous month and appeared on the previous month’s list of outstanding checks, you should write a journal entry to do the following:",
    "Definition of Checking Account": "A checking account is a bank account in which a company deposits money and can subsequently withdraw the money by writing a check, using a debit card, arranging for electronic transfers, etc.  Except for the uncollected funds associated with recently deposited checks from customers, the money in a checking account is available on demand. (This is why banks refer to the amounts in their customers’ checking accounts as demand deposits.) The balances in checking accounts are considered to be money and are reported on the company’s balance sheet as part of the current asset cash. (A bank’s balance sheet lists the total amount of its customers’ checking account balances as a current liability.) As part of its internal controls, a company should reconcile the checking account balance in its general ledger account with the balance in the bank’s records. This process is known as the bank reconciliation.",
    "Examples of Checking Accounts": "Companies often have several checking accounts. For example, it may have a separate checking account for each of the following:",
    "Definition of Balance a Checkbook": "To balance a company checkbook means comparing the amounts on the bank statement (or other bank account detail) to the amount in the company’s checkbook, check register, and the related general ledger account and arriving at the same correct balance in both records.  This process is referred to as preparing a bank reconciliation which will include two lists:",
    "Example of Balancing a Checkbook": "For a thorough discussion and example of balancing a checkbook see our major topic Bank Reconciliation and our Bank Reconciliation business forms referenced below.",
    "Definition of Per Annum": "Per annum means yearly or annually. It is a common phrase used to describe an interest rate. Often “per annum” is omitted, as in “I have a 4% mortgage loan.” or “This bond pays interest of 6%.”",
    "Example of Per Annum": "An example involves a supplier offering a credit customer an early-payment discount of 2% for paying an invoice in 10 days instead of paying the full amount in 30 days. In this example the supplier is giving up 2% of the invoice amount in order to be paid 20 days early. To compute the rate per annum we restate the amounts by multiplying both the “2%” and the “20 days” by 18 (in order to get close to the 365 days in a year). The result is a per annum rate of approximately 36%. Another example involves a business charging its customers 1.5% per month on any past due balance. The monthly rate of 1.5% can be converted to 18% per annum by multiplying the 1.5% times 12 months in a year. ",
    "Definition of Early Payment Discount": "An early payment discount is a reduction in the amount on a supplier’s invoice if the customer pays the supplier promptly. The early payment discount is also known as a cash discount. (The seller may refer to the early payment discount as a sales discount. The buyer may refer to the early payment discount as a purchases discount.) Not all companies offer early payment discounts. If the discount is allowed it will appear on the sales invoice.",
    "Examples of Early Payment Discounts": "Let’s assume that a company sells goods on credit and offers an early payment discount expressed as 1/10, net 30. This means that a customer is allowed to deduct 1% of the invoice amount, if payment is made within 10 days (instead of paying the full amount in 30 days). In other words, the customer saves 1% for paying 20 days early. Therefore, an invoice of $1,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30 means that the $1,000 obligation will be settled in full for $990 if it is paid within 10 days. If the customer has adequate cash or a readily available line of credit, the 1% early payment discount for paying 20 days early equates to a very attractive annualized rate of approximately 18%. If the customer does not have cash or a credit line available, the early payment discount may not be worth the risk of a potential bank overdraft fee.",
    "Definition of Direct Write-off Method": "The direct write-off method is one of the two methods normally associated with reporting accounts receivable and bad debts expense. (The other method is the allowance method.) Under the direct write-off method, bad debts expense is first reported on a company’s income statement when a customer’s account is actually written off. Often this occurs many months after the credit sale was made and is done with an entry that debits Bad Debts Expense and credits Accounts Receivable. With the direct write-off method, there is no contra asset account such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Therefore the entire balance in Accounts Receivable will be reported as a current asset on the company’s balance sheet. As a result, the balance sheet is likely to report an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected. It can also result in the Bad Debts Expense being reported on the income statement in the year after the year of the sale. For these reasons, the accounting profession does not allow the direct write-off method for financial reporting. Instead, the allowance method is to be used for the financial statements. However, the direct write-off method must be used for U.S. income tax reporting. Apparently the Internal Revenue Service does not want a company reducing its taxable income by anticipating an estimated amount of bad debts expense (which is what happens when using the allowance method).",
    "Definition of Annualizing": "Annualizing means taking a partial year amount and converting it to a full year amount. We will use several examples to illustrate how this works.",
    "Definition of Irrevocable Letter of Credit": "An irrevocable letter of credit is a financial instrument used by banks to guarantee a buyer’s obligations to a seller. It is irrevocable because the letter of credit cannot be modified unless all parties agree to the modifications. Irrevocable letters of credit are often used to facilitate international trade because of the additional risks involved. The irrevocable letter of credit assures the seller that it will be paid by the bank if the buyer fails to pay. Also see our related post: What is a letter of credit? Note that the irrevocable letter of credit is different from a line of credit. ",
    "Definition of Selling Price": "A selling price is the amount that a customer will pay to buy a product. If a retailer wants to earn a positive gross margin (or gross profit percentage), the selling price must include an additional amount that is added to the retailer’s cost of the product. This additional amount must be sufficient to cover the retailer’s selling, general and administrative expenses and some profit.",
    "Example of Computing a Selling Price": "Let’s use the following information:",
    "Definition of Job Order Costing": "Job order costing or job costing is a system for assigning and accumulating manufacturing costs of an individual unit of output. The job order costing system is used when the various items produced are sufficiently different from each other and each has a significant cost. (When a company’s output consists of continuous flows of identical, low-cost units, the process costing system is more appropriate.) Since there is a significant variation in the items manufactured, the job order costing system requires a separate job cost record for each item (or each job or special order). The job cost record will report each item’s direct materials and direct labor that were actually used and an assigned amount of manufacturing overhead. The job cost records also serve as the subsidiary ledger or documentation for the manufacturer’s cost of the work-in-process inventory, the finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold.",
    "Examples of Job Order Costing": "A few examples of the use of job order costing are:",
    "Definition of Cost Accounting": "Cost accounting is involved with the following:",
    "Examples of Cost Accounting": "A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer’s products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems. Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc. Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more. Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer’s check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",
    "Definition of Conversion Costs": "Conversion costs are the two categories of manufacturing costs that are needed to convert the direct materials into products:",
    "Examples of Conversion Costs": "An example of direct labor are the employees working on the assembly line of a manufacturer. Examples of manufacturing overhead include the utilities, indirect labor, repairs and maintenance, depreciation, etc. that is occurring within a company’s manufacturing facilities.",
    "Definition of Cost of Goods Manufactured": "The cost of goods manufactured is a calculation of the production costs of the goods that were completed during an accounting period. In other words, it includes the costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead that are included in the products that moved from the manufacturing area to the finished goods inventory during the accounting period. The calculation is presented as a schedule or statement.",
    "Example of the Cost of Goods Manufactured": "The formula and format for presenting the cost of goods manufactured is:",
    "Definition of Salaries and Wages": "Salaries and wages are forms of compensation paid to employees of a company.",
    "Salaries and Wages as Expenses on Income Statement": "Salaries and wages of a company’s employees working in nonmanufacturing functions (e.g. selling, general administration, etc.) are part of the expenses reported on the company’s income statement. Under the accrual method of accounting, the amounts are reported in the accounting period in which the employees earn the salaries and wages.",
    "Salaries and Wages of Employees in Manufacturing": "At a manufacturing company, the salaries and wages of employees in the manufacturing operations are assigned to the products manufactured. When the products are sold, the costs assigned to those products (including the manufacturing salaries and wages) are included in the cost of goods sold, which is reported on the income statement. (The costs of the products that are not sold are reported as inventory on the balance sheet. Hence, the inventory will contain some of the manufacturing salaries and wages. The salaries and wages of people in the nonmanufacturing functions such as selling, general administrative, etc. are reported directly on the current income statement as expenses in the period in which they were earned by the employees.",
    "Reporting of Inventory on Financial Statements": "Inventory is an asset and its ending balance is reported in the current asset  section of a company’s balance sheet. Inventory is not an income statement account. However, the change in inventory is a component in the calculation of the Cost of Goods Sold, which is often presented on a company’s income statement. An increase in inventory will be subtracted from a company’s purchases of goods, while a decrease in inventory will be added to a company’s purchase of goods to arrive at the cost of goods sold.  [Rather than simply showing the change in inventory as an adjustment to cost of goods, some income statements will show the calculation of Cost of Goods Sold as Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases = Goods Available – Ending Inventory.]",
    "Example of Presenting the Cost of Goods Sold Calculation": "Assume that a company’s beginning inventory was $100 and its ending inventory was $110, which is an increase of 10. Let’s assume that a company purchased $1,000 of goods during the accounting period. A common method of presenting the calculation of the cost of goods sold on the income statement is: Purchases of $1,000 minus the increase in inventory of $10 = $990. It is common for textbooks to show this calculation of the cost of goods sold on an income statement: Beginning Inventory of $100 + Purchases of $1,000 = Cost of Goods Available of $1,100 – Ending Inventory of $110 = $990. Hence, both presentations show the cost of goods sold of $990.",
    "Recap": "Again, inventory is a current asset that is reported on the balance sheet. The change in inventory is used to adjust the amount of purchases in order to report the cost of the goods that were actually sold. If some of the purchases were added to inventory, they are not part of the cost of goods sold.",
    "Definition of Manufacturing Costs": "Manufacturing costs are the costs of materials plus the costs to convert the materials into products. All manufacturing costs must be assigned to the units produced in order for a company’s external financial statements to comply with U.S. GAAP. The resulting unit costs are used for inventory valuation and for the calculation of the cost of goods sold.",
    "Example of Manufacturing Costs": "Manufacturing costs are typically divided into three categories: ",
    "Definition of Equivalent Unit of Production": "An equivalent unit of production is an expression of the amount of work done by a manufacturer on units of output that are partially completed at the end of an accounting period. Basically the fully completed units and the partially completed units are expressed in terms of fully completed units. Equivalent units are used in the production cost reports for the producing departments of manufacturers using a process costing system. Cost accounting textbooks are likely to present the cost calculations per equivalent unit of production under two cost flow assumptions: weighted-average and FIFO.",
    "Example of Equivalent Units of Production": "Assume that a manufacturer uses direct labor continuously in one of its production departments. During June, the department began with no units in inventory and then started and completed 10,000 units. In addition, it started 1,000 units but they were only 30% complete at the end of June. The production cost report for this department will indicate that it manufactured 10,300 (10,000 + 300) equivalent units of product during June. If the department’s direct labor cost was $103,000 during the month, it’s June direct labor cost per equivalent unit will be $10 ($103,000 divided by 10,300 equivalent units). This means that $100,000 (10,000 X $10) of labor costs will be assigned to the finished units and $3,000 (300 equivalent units X $10 labor cost per equivalent unit) will be assigned to the 1,000 partially completed units.",
    "Formula for Calculating a Retailer’s Cost of Goods Sold": "A retailer’s cost of goods sold is:",
    "Example of Calculating a Retailer’s Cost of Goods Sold": "Assume that a retailer’s information includes: net purchases including freight-in is $450,000; beginning inventory had a cost of $50,000; ending inventory had a cost of $60,000. Using the above information the cost of goods sold is $440,000. One calculation is: beginning inventory of $50,000 + net purchases of $450,000 = cost of goods available of $500,000 – $60,000 of ending inventory = cost of goods sold of $440,000. The other calculation is: net purchases of $450,000 minus the increase in inventory of $10,000 = the cost of goods sold of $440,000. When there is inflation, the retailer must also elect a cost flow assumption in order to determine the cost of the ending inventory, which of course is a factor in the calculation of the cost of goods sold.",
    "Definition of EOQ": "EOQ is the acronym for economic order quantity. The economic order quantity is the optimum quantity of an item to be purchased at one time in order to minimize the combined annual costs of ordering and carrying the item in inventory. EOQ is also referred to as the optimum lot size. The formula to calculate the economic order quantity (EOQ) is the square root of [(2 times the annual demand in units times the incremental cost to process an order) divided by (the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory)].",
    "Example of EOQ Calculation": "Assume that a company has steady demand of 12,000 units per year for one of its products. The company purchases the product from its supplier at a cost of $100 each. The company’s incremental cost to process an order is $144 and its incremental annual cost to carry the product in inventory is $16 per unit. EOQ = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 units of annual demand X $144 the incremental cost to process an order) / $16 the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory] = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 X $144) / $16] = the square root of [$3,456,000 / $16] = square root of 216,000 units = 465 units (rounded to a whole unit).",
    "Definition of Standard Cost": "A standard cost is described as a predetermined cost, an estimated future cost, an expected cost, a budgeted unit cost, a forecast cost, or as the “should be” cost. Standard costs are often an integral part of a manufacturer’s annual profit plan and operating budgets. When standard costs are used in a manufacturing setting, a product’s standard cost for a future accounting period  will consist of the following:",
    "Definition of Gross Profit Method": "The gross profit method is a technique for estimating the amount of ending inventory. The gross profit method might be used to estimate each month’s ending inventory or it might be used as part of a calculation to determine the approximate amount of inventory that has been lost due to theft, fire, or other reasons. The gross profit method of estimating ending inventory assumes that the gross profit percentage or the gross margin ratio is known. For example, if a company purchases goods for $80 and sells them for $100, its gross profit is $20. This results in a gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio of 20% of the selling price. Therefore, when the company has sales of $50,000 it is assumed that its cost of those goods will be $40,000 (80% of $50,000 in sales; or sales of $50,000 minus $10,000 of gross profit).  ",
    "Example of Gross Profit Method": "Assume you need to estimate the cost of a company’s July 31 inventory. The last time the inventory was calculated was seven months earlier on December 31 when it had a cost of $15,000. Since December 31, the company purchased goods having a cost of $42,000; its sales were $50,000; and the gross profit percentage has remained at 20% (hence its cost of goods sold would be 80% of sales). The inventory at the end of the day on July 31 is estimated as follows:",
    "Definition of Work-in-Process": "I use the term “work-in-process” to mean a manufacturer’s inventory that is not yet completed. I think of work-in-process as the goods that are on the factory floor of a manufacturer. The amount of Work-in-Process Inventory would be reported along with Raw Materials Inventory and Finished Goods Inventory on the manufacturer’s balance sheet as a current asset.",
    "Definition of Work-in-Progress": "I use the term “work-in-progress” to mean construction of long term assets (that will be used in the company’s business) that are not yet completed. For example, if a company is constructing an addition to its building and the work is only partially completed, the amount spent so far would be recorded as Work-in-Progress, Construction in Progress, or Construction Work-in-Progress (CWIP) and the account would be on the balance sheet as a long-term asset in the section entitled Property, Plant and Equipment. When the project is completed and put into service, the amount would be transferred out of CWIP and would be reported in the account Buildings within Property, Plant and Equipment. At that point, the depreciation of the addition will begin. (If a company is constructing an assembly line or a huge machine that will take time to build, the amounts would also be accumulated in CWIP. When the project is completed and is placed into service, the amount will be transferred from CWIP to Equipment and depreciation will begin.) To complicate matters, companies that produce items under a long-term contract will use an account entitled Construction-in-Process. Your question points out the need for caution and an understanding of what the communicator intends. Keep in mind that the sender of a message might not realize that there are important differences between slightly different terms.",
    "Definition of Normal Costing": "Normal costing for manufactured products consists of following:",
    "Examples of Managerial Accounting Topics": "Managerial accounting topics often include:",
    "Definitions of FIFO and LIFO": "FIFO and LIFO are two of the cost flow assumptions used by U.S. companies with inventory items. FIFO moves the first/oldest costs from inventory and reports them as the cost of goods sold and leaves the last/more recent costs in inventory. LIFO moves the latest/more recent costs from inventory and reports them as the cost of goods sold and leaves the first/oldest costs in inventory. A U.S. company may switch from FIFO to LIFO. However, after the switch the company must use LIFO consistently. ",
    "Reason for Using FIFO Instead of LIFO": "If a U.S. corporation’s cost of inventory items are continuously increasing and the corporation has been experiencing operating losses and negative taxable income, the use of FIFO means matching its oldest/lower costs with its current sales. The result is a larger gross profit and a positive operating income.",
    "Reason for Using LIFO": "If a U.S. corporation’s costs of inventory items are continuously increasing, a profitable U.S. corporation will have lower income tax payments with LIFO. This results from matching the most recent higher costs of its items to the most recent sales. (The higher cost of goods sold means lower net income and lower taxable income than FIFO.) Another reason for a company to use the LIFO cost flow assumption is to improve the matching of costs with sales. If the company had matched the old low costs using FIFO, the company would show a greater profit that was partly caused by merely holding some old inventory items.",
    "Definition of FIFO": "FIFO (which is the acronym for First In, First Out) is a cost flow assumption in which the oldest costs of inventory items are the first costs to be removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold. As a result, the most recent costs remain in inventory.",
    "Example of FIFO ": "Let’s assume that a company sold only one product and had 10 units on hand at the beginning of the accounting year with a cost of $19 each. During the year the company purchased an additional 145 units in this order: 40 units at $20, 50 units at $21, and 55 units at $22. Let’s also assume that the company uses the periodic inventory system, the FIFO cost flow assumption and that 130 units were sold. Therefore, there will be 25 units remaining in inventory. With the FIFO cost flow assumption, the first costs to come out of inventory and become the cost of goods sold are: 10@$19 + 40@$20 + 50@$21 + 30@$22. The costs that remain in inventory will be 25@$22.",
    "Definition of Production Costs": "In managerial accounting and cost accounting, production costs are the costs that occur in the manufacturing facilities. Production costs are also referred to as manufacturing costs, product costs, and a manufacturer’s inventoriable costs.",
    "Examples of Production Costs": "A manufacturer’s production costs consists of the costs for the following:",
    "Gross Profit Method Definition": "The gross profit method is a technique used to estimate the amount of ending inventory. The technique could be used for monthly financial statements when a physical inventory is not feasible. (However, it is no substitute for an annual physical inventory.) It is also used to estimate the amount of missing inventory caused by theft, fire or other disaster.",
    "Gross Profit Method Calculation": "Here’s how the gross profit method formula works. First you must determine the gross profit percentage (gross profit margin) that your company is currently experiencing. For example, if a retailer buys its merchandise for $0.70 and sells the merchandise for $1.00, it has a gross profit of $0.30. The gross profit of $0.30 divided by the selling price of $1.00 means a gross profit margin of 30% of sales. This also means that the retailer’s cost of goods sold is 70% of sales. Next, compute the sales value of the merchandise sold since the last time an inventory amount was known. Let’s assume that the sales amounted to $100,000. Given the sales value of $100,000 the cost of the goods sold should be approximately $70,000 (70% from above times $100,000). Add the cost of the goods purchased since the last inventory to that inventory amount. Let’s assume that previous inventory amount was $15,000 and that there were purchases of $75,000. That means the cost of goods that were available for sale totals $90,000 ($15,000 + $75,000). Since the estimated cost of goods sold was $70,000 (from above), the estimated cost of goods in inventory should be approximately $20,000 ($90,000 minus $70,000). Be certain that the gross profit percentage is indicative of reality and remember that the resulting amount is an estimate.",
    "Definition of Work-in-process Inventory": "Work-in-process (WIP) inventory pertains to the goods for which the manufacturing has begun, but not yet completed. In other words, WIP is the items on the factory floor.  Work-in-process inventory is also the general ledger account that reports the cost of the goods that are on the factory floor. In this current asset account are the cost of the direct materials, direct labor and the allocation of manufacturing overhead for the goods on the factory floor. In a perpetual inventory system, when the goods in WIP are completed, their cost will be moved from the WIP account into the Finished Goods Inventory account. The cost of a manufacturer’s work-in-process inventory are to be disclosed in the company’s financial statements.",
    "Example of Work-in-Process Inventory": "Generally, the amounts in work-in-process (WIP) are relatively small compared to a manufacturer’s cost of goods sold and its finished goods inventory.",
    "Definition of Inventory Shrinkage": "Inventory shrinkage is a term to describe the loss of inventory. The shrinkage could be the result of theft, breakage, poor recordkeeping, etc. The term shrinkage may also be used by manufacturers to describe the loss of raw materials during their production processes. This shrinkage is also known as spoilage or waste and it can be either normal or abnormal.",
    "Example of Inventory Shrinkage": "Assume that a retailer’s computerized inventory records indicates that 961 units of Product X are on hand. However, a physical count of Product X indicates that only 891 units are on hand. The difference of 70 units is the inventory shrinkage. The retailer’s inventory shrinkage might be due to shoplifting, employee theft, discarding defective units without preparing the necessary paperwork for updating the computerized records,  etc. A manufacturer of baked food items will experience some shrinkage throughout its processes due to ingredients being of a lesser quality, ingredients adhering to the beaters and bowls, evaporation, less experienced bakers, etc. ",
    "Definition of Safety Stock": "Safety stock is an additional quantity of an item held by a company in inventory in order to reduce the risk that the item will be out of stock. Safety stock acts as a buffer in case the sales of an item are greater than planned and/or the company’s supplier is unable to deliver additional units at the expected time. If the company is a manufacturer, a safety stock of materials could minimize the risk of production being disrupted.   Of course there are additional holding or carry costs associated with safety stock. However, the holding costs could be less than the cost of not filing a customer’s order on time or having to stop its production line.",
    "Example of Safety Stock": "Assume that a company uses the economic order quantity (EOQ) model to determine the amount of product or materials it orders. Since the model requires an assumption (estimate) of annual demand, there is a risk that demand will be greater than the estimate used. Let’s say that the company’s EOQ is 1,000 units. As a precaution, the company may decide to always have an additional 100 units on hand as its safety stock. If demand is not constant, the company could increase the quantity of its safety stock during its peak sales periods and then reduce the quantity during periods of low sales.",
    "Inflation and the Cost of Goods Sold": "Generally speaking, a company selling goods during periods of inflation will see an increase in its cost of goods sold. When and by how much will depend on the cost flow assumption that is used. In the U.S., there are several cost flow assumptions available. However, a company must select one and then use it consistently. Below is an overview of three cost flow assumptions and how they affect the cost of goods sold. (However, the cost flow assumption will also affect the company’s inventory valuation, as well as its gross profit, net income, income tax payments, and more.)",
    "More on FIFO": "Since FIFO (first-in, first out) is moving the older/lower costs to the cost of goods sold, the recent/higher costs are in inventory. The lower cost of goods sold generally results in larger amounts of gross profit, net income, taxable income, income tax payments, and certain financial ratios.  Economists may state that the larger profits using FIFO are illusory since the goods (that were sold) will have to be replaced at higher, current costs. To avoid paying income taxes on these illusory or phantom profits, many U.S. companies have switched from FIFO to LIFO.",
    "More on LIFO": "Since LIFO (last-in, first out) is moving the recent/higher costs to the cost of goods sold, the older/lower costs remain in inventory. The higher cost of goods sold generally results in smaller amounts of gross profit, net income taxable income, income tax payments, and certain financial ratios. Economists feel more comfortable with LIFO since the cost of goods sold is closer to the replacement costs of the goods. The smaller amount of gross profit being reported on the income statement from using LIFO eliminates much of the illusory profit and brings attention to the need to increase selling prices or take other action to maintain its same level of profits. Avoiding paying income taxes on the illusory profits gives the company some of the money that will be required to replace the goods at the new inflated costs. Keep in mind that these are general comments. You should always determine the specific facts for your situation and should consult with a professional accountant and tax adviser.",
    "Difference between LIFO and FIFO": "If there were no changes in the cost of inventory items (purchased or manufactured), there would be no difference between the LIFO and FIFO cost flows. Since costs have historically increased, the latest or most recent costs are higher than the older costs. When the recent higher costs are removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement, the resulting gross profit will be lower. If the corporation ends up with lower taxable income, it likely means lower income tax expense. ",
    "Example Comparing LIFO and FIFO": "ABC Store purchases a product and then sells them to its retail customers. ABC began on January 2 and purchased 1 unit of product in each of the following months at these costs: $10 in January, $12 in April, $13 in October. Therefore, ABC’s cost of goods available amounted to $35. Next, assume that 2 units were sold and 1 is in inventory on December 31. Also assume that the retail price remained constant at $16 each. Using the LIFO cost flow assumption, the cost of the 2 units sold will be $25 ($13 + $12)\nUsing the FIFO cost flow assumption, the cost of the 2 units sold will be $22 ($10 + $12) Gross profit using LIFO: Sales of $32 – COGS $25 = $7\nGross profit using FIFO: Sales of $32 – COGS $22 = $10   Note that the LIFO gross profit is $3 less than the FIFO gross profit.",
    "Definition of Product Cost per Unit": "In accounting, a product’s cost is defined as the direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Other costs such as advertising, preparing invoices, delivery expense, office salaries, office rent and utilities, and interest on loans are examples of expenses that are not assigned to the products. Instead, these costs are described as period costs since they are expensed immediately in the accounting period in which they were incurred. Of course for a company to be profitable, it must have sufficient sales revenues (quantity and prices) to cover both the product costs of the units sold and the other expenses of the accounting period.",
    "Example of Product Cost per Unit": "The product cost per unit is used for valuing a company’s inventory and for determining the cost of goods sold. Since some of the manufacturing overhead costs are fixed in total (manufacturing rent, depreciation, managers’ salaries, repairs, etc.), the per unit cost of a product depends on the number of units manufactured during a given year. In other words, the cost of a product is not known with precision, even though accountants will compute the per unit cost to the nearest penny.",
    "Definition of Materials Usage Variance": "The materials usage variance (in a standard costing system) results from using more or less than the standard quantity of direct materials that should have been used for the actual goods produced. If the actual quantity of the materials used was more than the standard quantity allowed for the good output, the materials usage variance is unfavorable and the general ledger account Materials Usage Variance will have a debit balance. If the actual quantity of the materials used was less than the standard quantity allowed for the good output, the variance is favorable and the Materials Usage Variance account will have a credit balance. While using standard costs is helpful for planning and controlling a company’s operations, the company’s actual costs must be used to prepare its external financial statements.",
    "Example of Materials Usage Variance": "Even though a company uses a standard cost system in its accounting, the company’s external financial statements must comply with the historical cost principle. In other words, the external financial statement cannot simply report what the costs should have been (the standard cost). This means that the debit or credit balance in the Materials Usage Variance account must be included in the external financial statements. If the standard quantity of the materials that should have been used was realistic (attainable) but the actual quantity exceeded the standard quantity due to inefficiencies, the materials usage variance will have to be reported on the income statement as an addition to the standard amount of the Cost of Goods Sold or as a separate line item (in the period when the inefficiencies occurred). Since companies have multiple inventory turnovers each year, small balances in the variance accounts (for whatever reason) are generally combined with the standard amount of the cost of goods sold. Significant variances which are not caused by inefficiencies may have to be divided between the work-in-process inventory, the finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold.  ",
    "Definition of Determining the Cost of Missing Inventory": "The approximate cost of missing inventory is the difference between 1) the cost of the inventory items that are physically present or accounted for, and 2) the cost of the inventory that should be on hand based on the accounting information.",
    "Examples of Determining the Cost of Missing Inventory": "If a company’s accounting records or its inventory system uses the perpetual inventory system (and it is maintained properly), determining the cost of the missing inventory is easy. You simply subtract the cost of the items that are in inventory from the costs shown in the perpetual inventory system. If the perpetual inventory method is not used (or it is not maintained properly) you can determine the cost of the missing inventory with the following steps:",
    "Definition of Cost to Store Inventory": "The cost to store, hold or carry inventory is the total of the following:",
    "Example of Cost to Store Inventory": "A company estimated its annual cost to carry an additional increment of inventory to be 15% of the item’s cost. This estimate was based on four components listed in the above definition. The cost of each of the components will likely be different for each company and the cost will likely vary over time.  Some of the costs are not easy to compute, but can be substantial. For example, the cost of holding items can be significant if the items become obsolete due to breakthroughs in technology. If the company cuts back on the quantity of goods it orders or the quantity of goods it produces in order to reduce its holding costs, the company will incur additional ordering costs or production set up costs.  ",
    "Definition of LIFO Layer": "LIFO is the acronym for Last-In, First-Out. In the context of inventory, it means that the cost of the most recently purchased units will be the first costs to be matched with the recent sales on the income statement. (The oldest costs will remain in inventory.) When the end of the year quantity of inventory increases, the cost of the recently added units becomes a new layer—another LIFO layer. If the end of the year inventory quantity decreases, LIFO layers are “peeled away” starting with the latest (most recent) layer first. We will illustrate this with the following example.",
    "Example of LIFO Layers": "Jay Corp. began operations in 2021  using the LIFO cost flow assumption. It ended the year 2021 with 10 units in inventory at a cost of $20 each. Therefore, its LIFO inventory consisted of one layer (its base layer) having a cost of $200. During 2022 Jay Corp. purchased 100 units at $21 each and sold 95 units. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, it is assumed that the 95 units sold had the most recent cost of $21 (even if the most recently purchased units were not physically shipped out to customers). The LIFO cost flow assumption results in the cost of the 10 units from 2021 remaining in inventory (10 X $20 = $200) and an additional layer being added in 2022. The 2022 LIFO layer will be the 2022 cost of 5 units (5 X $21 = $105). The LIFO inventory cost at the end of 2022 will be the 2021 LIFO base layer of $200 + the 2022 LIFO layer of $105…for a total LIFO inventory cost of $305. Next, let’s assume that in 2023 Jay Corp. purchased 100 units at $22 and sells 102 units. The LIFO cost flow assumption is that the 102 units sold would consist of the cost of the recently purchased 100 units at $22 plus the cost of 2 units purchased in 2022 at $21 each. In other words, Jay Corp. had to peel away part of the 2022 layer since that was the most recently added layer. This means the LIFO cost of inventory at the end of 2023 will consist of the 2021 LIFO base layer of 10 units at $20 each + the 2022 LIFO layer having 3 units at their 2022 cost of $21 each…for a total LIFO inventory cost at the end of 2023 of $263 ($200 + $63). If Jay Corp. increases its inventory during 2024 by 4 units at a cost of $22 each, a new 2024 LIFO layer of 4 units will be added. The LIFO cost for the inventory at the end of 2024 will be the following: the 2021 base layer (10 units at the 2021 cost of $20 each) + the 2022 LIFO layer (3 units at the 2022 cost of $21 each) + the 2024 LIFO layer (4 units at the 2024 cost of $22 each).",
    "Definition of Reorder Point": "The reorder point is the quantity of units in inventory at which time an order should be placed to purchase additional units. The reorder point is calculated by using the following information:",
    "Example of the Reorder Point": "Assume that a company has determined that the reorder point for its Product X is 80 units and its economic order quantity is 400 units. When the inventory level of Product X drops to 80 units, the company places an order for 400 units. The 80 units should be sufficient for meeting its sales (and maintaining some additional units as safety stock) until the 400 units arrive.",
    "Definition of Book Depreciation": "Book depreciation is the amount recorded in the company’s general ledger accounts and reported on the company’s  financial statements. This depreciation is based on the matching principle of accounting. ",
    "Example of Book Depreciation": "Let’s assume that equipment used in a business has a cost of $500,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years. If the company assumes no salvage value at the end of the 10 years, the annual depreciation expense recorded in the general ledger accounts and reported on the financial statements will likely be $50,000 each year. Each year the company is matching $50,000 of the equipment’s cost to that year’s revenues that are earned because of the equipment.",
    "Definition of Tax Depreciation": "Tax depreciation refers to the amounts reported on the company’s income tax returns and in the U.S. the tax depreciation is based on the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The tax regulations specify the useful life of assets but also allow for accelerated depreciation or the immediate expensing of certain amounts on some companies’ tax returns. There is no regulation that requires the tax depreciation to be the same as the book depreciation in a given year. (However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense for both will be limited to the asset’s cost.)",
    "Example of Tax Depreciation": "Assuming the company purchases equipment of $500,000 the IRS regulations may require that the equipment be depreciated over 7 years and allows an accelerated method of depreciation. In some years the regulations may allow certain companies to charge the entire equipment’s cost to depreciation in the first year. These regulations result in a company having larger depreciation deductions sooner and therefore receiving the income tax savings sooner. You can learn more about tax depreciation from www.IRS.gov or from a tax adviser.",
    "Difference Between Book and Tax Depreciation": "Generally, the difference between book depreciation and tax depreciation involves the “timing” of when the cost of an asset will appear as depreciation expense on a company’s financial statements versus the depreciation expense on the company’s income tax return. Hence, the depreciation expense in each year will likely be different, but the total of all of the years’ depreciation expense for an asset will likely add up to the same total.  The difference between book and tax depreciation leads some people to say, “Oh, the company has two sets of books.” The fact is the company must 1) maintain depreciation records for the financial statement depreciation that is based on the matching principle, and also 2) maintain depreciation records for the tax return depreciation that is based on the IRS rules.",
    "Definition of Asset Salvage Value": "In accounting, an asset’s salvage value is the estimated amount that a company will receive at the end of a plant asset’s useful life. It is the amount of an asset’s cost that will not be part of the depreciation expense during the years that the asset is used in the business. Salvage value is also referred to as disposal value, residual value, or scrap value. ",
    "Example of Asset Salvage Value": "Perhaps the most common calculation of an asset’s salvage value is to assume there will be no salvage value. As a result, the entire cost of the asset used in the business will be charged to depreciation expense during the years of the asset’s expected useful life. A salvage value of zero is reasonable since it is assumed that the asset will no longer be useful at the point when the depreciation expense ends. Even if the company receives a small amount, it may be offset by costs of removing and disposing of the asset.",
    "Definition of Scrap Value": "In cost accounting, scrap value refers to a relatively insignificant amount that a manufacturer receives from the sale of production materials that remain after the manufacture of its products.  In financial accounting, the term scrap value might be used instead of the more common terms of salvage value, disposal value, or residual value when calculating the depreciation of an asset used in the business. In this situation, scrap value is the expected or estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.",
    "Examples of Scrap Value": "A manufacturer of aluminum products melts aluminum. In the process it separates out small amounts of aluminum containing impurities. The relatively small amount of money that the manufacturer receives for the impure aluminum is known as the scrap value. For examples of scrap value that is meant to be the disposal, residual, or salvage value of a plant asset, see our major topic Depreciation. ",
    "Definition of Amortization": "In general, the word amortization means to systematically reduce a balance over time. In accounting, amortization is conceptually similar to the depreciation of a plant asset or the depletion of a natural resource.",
    "Examples of Amortization": "Perhaps the most common example of the term amortization is the amortization schedule associated with a mortgage loan. For a 15-year mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate and monthly payments, the amortization schedule shows the same total amount for each of the monthly payments. However, since each month’s principal payment reduces the loan’s principal balance, the next month’s interest payment will be slightly less and the principal payment slightly more. In addition to the amortization schedule for loans payable and loans receivable, accountants use the term  amortization to mean the systematic allocation of an asset or liability amount from the balance sheet to expense (or revenue) on the income statement. Here are a few examples:",
    "Purpose of Depreciation": "The purpose of depreciation is to achieve the matching principle of accounting. That is, a company is attempting to match the historical cost of a productive asset (that has a useful life of more than a year) to the revenues earned from using the asset. Since it is difficult to precisely match a productive asset’s cost to a company’s revenues, the asset’s cost is usually allocated to the years in which the asset is used. In other words, depreciation systematically moves the asset’s cost from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement over the asset’s useful life. Accountants point out that depreciation is an allocation process which does not result in reporting the asset’s market value.",
    "Example of Recording Depreciation": "The accounting entry to record depreciation is:",
    "Definition of Direct and Indirect Costs": "The depreciation expense associated with the asset can be direct cost or an indirect cost or both a direct and indirect cost. Direct costs are traceable to a cost object (department, product, etc.) without any allocation. Indirect costs must be allocated to a cost object since the cost is not traceable to the cost object.",
    "Example of Depreciation Being a Direct Cost and/or an Indirect Cost": "Assume a company has a variety of manufacturing departments, one of which is the Finishing Department. The Finishing Department’s equipment is used for producing only one product line, which has three different versions (basic, deluxe, and premier). Each of the three versions uses a different amount of the equipment’s time. The depreciation of the equipment is a direct cost to the Finishing Department. It is a direct cost because the equipment is used exclusively in the Finishing Department, and therefore does not require any allocation to get it to that cost object. If the annual depreciation on the equipment in the Finishing Departments is $60,000 a year, the $60,000 is a direct cost of the Finishing Department. The depreciation of the equipment is also an indirect cost of the products using the equipment. It is an indirect cost because the company has to allocate the depreciation to the three versions of the product line that are processed in the Finishing Department. Let’s assume that the allocation is based on the amount of the equipment’s time that was used. If the equipment will operate for 6,000 hours a year, the depreciation could be allocated to the products using the Finishing Department’s equipment at the rate of $10 per hour ($60,000/6,000 hours). If the basic version of the product requires 1 hour, each basic version will be allocated $10. If the deluxe version requires 2 hours, each deluxe version will be allocated $20.  Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, or burden.",
    "Definition of Units-of-Activity Depreciation": "The units-of-activity depreciation is unique among the common methods of depreciation in that the useful life of the asset being depreciated is not expressed or calculated based on the passage of time (such as years). Instead, the depreciation is expressed and calculated based on the asset’s usage. Under the units-of-activity method of depreciation, the asset’s cost (less any salvage value) is allocated to the accounting periods based on the asset’s usage (units produced, activity, etc.) during each of the accounting periods. (Hence, the number of years, partial years, passage of time, etc. are not relevant with the units-of-activity method of depreciation.) ",
    "Example of Units-of-Activity Depreciation": "Assume that a company acquires a robot that is expected to be useful for performing a simple operation on 100,000 units of product. The robot has a cost of $225,000 and is expected to have a salvage value of $25,000 at the end of the 100,000 operations. Under the units-of-activity method, the company will record $2 of depreciation for every robot operation. (Cost of $225,000 – $25,000 of expected salvage value divided by the expected 100,000 operations.) In an accounting year when 8,000 robot operations occur, the depreciation will be $16,000. In a year when 23,000 operations occur, the depreciation will be $46,000. The robot depreciation will continue until a total of $200,000 of depreciation has been taken (and the book value will be $25,000). The units of activity method of depreciation is also referred to as the units-of-production method.",
    "What Accumulated Depreciation Tells Us": "An asset’s accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the asset’s cost to indicate the asset’s book value. The book value indicates the maximum amount of future depreciation remaining. Since depreciation is defined as the allocation of an asset’s cost based on the estimated useful life, the book value of the asset is not an indication of the asset’s market value. For example, a building in an excellent location may be increasing in value even though the accumulated depreciation is increasing and therefore the book value is decreasing. The amount reported in the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation merely reports the total amount of an asset’s cost that has been moved to the income statement in the form of depreciation expense since the asset was acquired.",
    "Definition of Mid-Month Convention": "In depreciation, the mid-month convention means that an asset placed into service anytime during a given month is assumed to have been placed into service in the middle of that month. As a result, there will be one-half month of depreciation in that month.  The same is true for the disposal of an asset. There will be one-half month of depreciation in the month of the disposal. The mid-month convention is pertinent for the income tax depreciation for certain property.  You can find more on this in the Internal Revenue Service Publication 946.",
    "Examples of Mid-Month Convention": "Under the mid-month convention, if a company put a warehouse into service on October 6, it is assumed that the warehouse was put into service in the middle of October and there should be one-half month of depreciation in October. If a building is placed into service on October 23, it is assumed that the building was put into service in the middle of October. This also means there should be one-half month of depreciation for October. If a company disposes of an asset on October 25, it is assumed to have been disposed of in the middle of October and one-half month of depreciation is taken for October. If an asset is disposed of on October 3, it is also assumed that the asset was disposed of in the middle of October and one-half month of depreciation is taken for October.",
    "Definition of Biweekly Payroll": "Biweekly payroll refers to paydays that occur 26 times per year (52 weeks in a year divided by 2 weeks = 26 times per year). With 26 paydays in the year and 12 months in a year, some months will have 3 biweekly paydays since 26 paydays divided by 12 months = 2.16667 paydays per month.",
    "Definition of Semimonthly Payroll": "Semimonthly payroll refers to paydays that occur 24 times per year (12 months in a year multiplied by 2 paydays per month = 24 paydays). With 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year, each semimonthly pay period will have on average 2.16667 weeks per semimonthly payday. ",
    "Example of Biweekly Payroll": "Let’s assume that a company pays its employees biweekly on every other Friday. If a new employee agrees to an annual salary of $52,000 the employee will be earning $2,000 ($52,000 divided by 26 paydays) during each biweekly pay period. The employee’s pay records will indicate a gross salary of $2,000 each biweekly payday.",
    "Example of Semimonthly Payroll": "Now let’s assume that another company pays its employees semimonthly on the 15th day and the last day of every month. If it hires a new employee at an annual salary of $52,000 the employee will be earning $2,166.67 ($52,000 divided by 24 paydays) during each semimonthly pay period. The employee’s pay records will indicate a gross salary of $2,166.67 each semimonthly payday.",
    "Definition of Fringe Benefit Rate": "A fringe benefit rate is a percentage that results from dividing the cost of an employee’s fringe benefits by the wages paid to the employee for the hours actually worked.",
    "Example of Fringe Benefit Rate": "Let’s assume that a company operates 5 days a week for 8 hours a day for 52 weeks a year resulting in a total of 2,080 hours per year. Next, let’s assume that during the year an employee earns $20 per hour, and is entitled to 25 days or 200 hours off with pay (vacation, holidays, sick days). Therefore, the employee’s wages for working on the job will be 1,880 hours per year (2,080 hours minus 200 hours) multiplied by $20 per hour = $37,600 for a year. Next let’s assume the following are the annual costs for the fringe benefits earned by the employee and paid by the employer:",
    "Definition of Payroll Taxes": "The payroll taxes are the federal, state, and local taxes that pertain to the wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, etc. of a company’s employees.  Some of the employee-related payroll taxes are:",
    "Examples of Payroll Taxes Reported on the Income Statement": "Examples of the payroll taxes paid by the employer/company and therefore reported as expenses on the company’s income statement include the following:",
    "Definition of FUTA Tax": "FUTA is the acronym for the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and is associated with a federal payroll or employment tax paid solely by the employer. (This unemployment tax is in addition to each state’s unemployment tax.) Although the FUTA tax is paid by the employer, the amount is based on each employee’s wages, salary, commissions, etc. Often the FUTA tax ends up being 0.6% (6% minus a credit of 5.4%) of the first $7,000 per year of each employee’s wages, salary, commissions, etc.",
    "Example of FUTA Tax": "After the credit, the employer’s maximum cost for FUTA per year per employee will be $42 ($7,000 x 0.006). If an employee earns $5,000 during a calendar year, the employer’s cost for that employee will be $30 ($5,000 x 0.006).",
    "Accounting for FUTA Tax": "In the double-entry system of accounting, the FUTA tax results in the following entry:",
    "Definition of Payroll Withholdings for Health Insurance": "Payroll withholdings for health insurance are the amounts deducted from employees’ pay for their portion of the cost for the company’s health insurance plan.",
    "Example of Payroll Withholdings for Health Insurance": "Assume that the cost of a company’s health insurance plan is $300 per biweekly pay period and that the employee is responsible for paying 25% of the cost through payroll withholding. Therefore, the withholding is $75 per pay period. One way to record the withholdings is to credit Health Insurance Expense for the $75 withheld from the employee. When the company pays the full cost of the health insurance plan it will debit the amount to Health Insurance Expense. The combination of the insurance company’s billing amount and the amount withheld from the employee will result in the company’s health insurance expense per biweekly pay period of $225 for the employee. Another way to record the withholdings is to credit a current liability account such as Employee Withholdings for Insurance for the $75 withheld from the employee. When the company pays the insurance company’s invoice, the current liability account will be debited for $75. Either technique will result in the company having an expense for $225 per pay period for the employee.",
    "Definition of Gross Wages": "Gross wages are the amounts earned by employees before the payroll withholding taxes and other deductions are subtracted. Sometimes gross wages is used to describe the amounts earned by hourly-paid employees. However, it is common for gross wages to mean all forms of taxable compensation including wages, salaries, tips, commissions, bonuses, etc.",
    "Gross Wages vs Net Wages": "If an employee works 40 hours during the week of December 25-31 and earns $20 per hour, the gross wages earned  are $800. Net wages are an employee’s gross wages minus the deductions for payroll withholding taxes and other items. If the gross pay is $800 and the total payroll deductions amount to $200, the employee’s net wages will be $600. Net wages is also known as the net pay, take-home pay, and/or the amount that the employee “clears”. ",
    "How Gross Wages Are Reported": "Under the What is the accrual basis of accounting?”>accrual basis of accounting, the employer will report on its financial statements the gross wages that were earned by the employees (and incurred by the employer) during the accounting period.  [Under the cash basis of accounting, the employer’s financial statements will report gross wages based on the amounts that were paid to the employees during the accounting period.] The amount that the employer reports to the Internal Revenue Service on employee’s Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statement is the amount of the gross wages that were paid to the employee during the calendar year.",
    "Example of Wages on Financial Statements vs W-2": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, if an employee earns gross wages of $800 in the last week in December, the gross wages (and related amounts) are reported on the company’s December financial statements. However, if the wages earned during the week of December 25-31 are not paid until January 5, the wages will be included in the W-2 form for the year in which they are paid.",
    "Definition of Annual Wage Limit": "Annual wage limit is a payroll accounting term that is associated with the Social Security payroll tax. (The annual wage limit is also known as the annual wage base, wage ceiling, taxable maximum, and maximum taxable earnings.) The annual wage limit applies to only the Social Security payroll tax portion of the FICA payroll tax. (There is no annual wage limit for the Medicare payroll tax portion of FICA.) The annual wage limit for the Social Security tax is adjusted each year. For the year 2025, the annual wage limit is $176,100. (It was $168,600 for 2024.) This means that in the year 2025, only the first $176,100 of an employee’s gross wages, salaries, bonuses, etc. (or self-employed’s business earnings) will be subject to the Social Security tax of 6.2%. In addition to the amounts withheld from its employees, the employer must match the amount withheld. (Self-employed individuals pay both the employee and the employer portions of the payroll tax.)",
    "Example of Annual Wage Limit": "Assume that an employee has gross wages of $190,000 during the year 2025. Only $176,100 of the employee’s wages are subject to the Social Security tax of 6.2%. As a result, the amount withheld from the employee’s pay for the Social Security tax will be $10,918.20 ($176,100 X 0.062). In addition, the employer must match the amount withheld and remit $21,836.40 ($10,918.20 + $10,918.20) to the U.S. government.",
    "No Annual Wage Limit for Medicare Tax": "Unlike the Social Security tax, the Medicare tax does not have an annual wage limit. Therefore, every dollar of the employees’ gross pay is subject to the Medicare tax of 1.45% and must be matched by the employer. However, the Additional Medicare Tax for higher income individuals is not matched by the employer.",
    "Examples of Payroll Taxes Withheld from Employees and Matched by Employer": "Examples of payroll taxes that are paid by both the employee and the employer include the following:",
    "Examples of Payroll Taxes Withheld from Employees’ Wages Not Matched by Employer": "Examples of payroll taxes which are withheld from an employee’s gross wages and then remitted to the government agency by the employer include:",
    "Examples of Payroll Taxes Paid Solely by the Employer": "Some payroll taxes are not withheld from the employees’ wages. Instead, the entire amount is paid by the employer. Examples include the following:",
    "Definition of Additional Medicare Tax": "The Additional Medicare Tax is one of the U.S. government’s payroll withholding taxes that is paid solely by employees and the self-employed. In other words, the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax. The Additional Medicare Tax is 0.9% (0.009) of an employee’s gross pay (wages, salaries, bonuses, etc.) that are in excess of $200,000 during a calendar year. The Additional Medicare Tax is in addition to the (regular) Medicare payroll tax and the Social Security payroll tax.\nRelated: What is the difference between Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes? ",
    "Example of Additional Medicare Tax": "Sam is employed by Jones Corporation and had gross pay of $300,000 during the year. In addition to the regular Medicare tax (and the Social Security tax), Sam must pay the Additional Medicare Tax. In Sam’s case, the Additional Medicare Tax is 0.9% of $100,000 (Sam’s gross pay of $300,000 minus $200,000) which amounts to $900. The $900 is withheld from Sam’s gross pay and is remitted by Jones Corporation to the U.S. Treasury.",
    "Difference between the regular Medicare Tax and Additional Medicare Tax": "The regular Medicare tax is withheld from an employee’s gross pay without limit at the rate of 1.45% of gross pay. In our example, Sam’s regular Medicare tax for the year is $4,350 ($300,000 X 0.0145). Jones Corporation must match the regular Medicare tax withholding and therefore must remit $8,700 ($4,350 + $4,350) in regular Medicare tax to the U.S. Treasury. The Additional Medicare Tax is paid only by Sam through payroll withholding. Jones Corporation does not match the Additional Medicare Tax and remits the $900 that was withheld from Sam’s gross pay. Information on the Additional Medicare Tax can be found at www.irs.gov.",
    "Definition of Gross Pay": "Gross pay is the amount an employee is paid before the employer withholds FICA (Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes), income taxes (federal, state, local) if applicable, and other amounts such as wage garnishments, insurance payments, union dues, savings and retirement contributions, etc.",
    "Gross Pay vs Net Pay": "Net pay is the amount remaining after payroll taxes and other amounts are deducted from an employee’s gross pay. Net pay is the amount of the employee’s paycheck, which is often referred to as the employee’s “take-home pay” or the amount the employee “cleared”.",
    "How Gross Pay is Calculated": "Some employees’ gross pay is determined by multiplying the hours worked times the employee’s hourly pay rate. For instance, if an employee works 40 hours in the workweek and has a $25 per hour pay rate, the employee’s gross pay for the week is $1,000. If the employee works 30 hours in the following week, the employee’s gross pay will be $750 (30 hours X $25). Some employees’ gross pay is in the form of a salary. Often salaried employees are paid semimonthly or biweekly. For example, if an administrative assistant has an annual gross salary of $48,000 per year, the person’s semimonthly gross pay will be $2,000 ($48,000/24 pay periods). A person with an annual gross salary of $48,000 who is paid biweekly will have a biweekly gross pay of $1,846 ($48,000/26 pay periods). Gross pay can also include commissions based on sales, pieces produced per hour, bonuses based on achieving a stated goal, etc.",
    "Definition of Equity Financing": "Equity financing involves increasing the owner’s equity of a sole proprietorship or increasing the stockholders’ equity of a corporation to acquire an asset. When a corporation issues additional shares of common stock the number of issued and outstanding shares will increase. This increase will cause the previous stockholders’ ownership percentage to be reduced.",
    "Definition of Debt Financing": "Debt financing means borrowing money in order to acquire an asset. Financing with debt is referred to as financial leverage. Using debt financing allows the existing stockholders to maintain their percentage of ownership, since no new stock is being issued. However, the additional debt adds risk and may result in higher interest rates for future loans. Debt financing often comes with strict conditions or covenants regarding interest and principal payments, maintaining certain financial ratios, and more. Failure to meet those conditions can result in severe consequences. In the U.S., a benefit of debt financing is that the interest on the debt is an income tax deductible expense. This income tax savings will partially offset the interest expense on the debt.",
    "Definition of Bond’s Price": "A bond’s price is the present value of the following future cash amounts:",
    "Example of a Bond’s Price": "Let’s assume there is a $100,000 bond with a stated interest rate of 9% and a remaining life of 5 years. This means that the bond is promising to pay $4,500 at the end of each of the 10 remaining semiannual periods plus $100,000 at the end of the bond’s life. If an investor’s goal is to earn 9% and the market interest rate is 9%, the investor will pay $100,000 for the bond. However, if the market interest rates increase to 10%, any investor will be able to earn $5,000 semiannually on a $100,000 investment. Obviously, the 9% bond (paying only $4,500 semiannually) will not get sold for $100,000. To get sold, the price will have to be less than $100,000. For an investor to buy the 9% bond in a 10% market, the bond’s price will have to drop to an amount that will provide the buyer with a yield to maturity of 10%. Let’s assume that the present value calculation indicates that the price would have to be $96,000. The cash payments of $4,500 every six months for five years on the $96,000 cash investment plus the gain of $4,000 (receiving $100,000 in 5 years versus the investment of $96,000) will result in the required yield of 10%.",
    "Definition of Effective Interest Rate": "The effective interest rate is the true rate of interest earned. It can also mean the market interest rate, the yield to maturity, the discount rate, the internal rate of return, the annual percentage rate (APR), and the targeted or required interest rate.",
    "Example of the Effective Interest Rate": "Assume that a corporation issues a $1,000 bond with a stated, contractual, face, or nominal interest rate of 5%. This means that the corporation will pay exactly $50 per year during the life of the bond plus the principal amount at maturity. Let’s also assume that after the bonds are issued the market interest rates increase by one percentage point. As a result the 5% bond will lose some of its value because the contractual payment of $50 per year is not worth $1,000 when the market is paying $60 per year for a similar $1,000 bond. An investor will purchase the 5% bond only if the cost is low enough to yield 6% over the remaining life of the bond. In other words, the investor will pay less than the $1,000 so that the effective interest rate for the remaining life of the bond will be 6%.",
    "Definition of Amortization of Premium on Bonds Payable": "The amortization of the premium on bonds payable is the systematic movement of the amount of premium received when the corporation issued the bonds. The premium was received because the bonds’ stated interest rate was greater than the market interest rate. The amount of the premium is recorded in a separate bond-related liability account. Over the life of the bonds the premium amount will be systematically moved to the income statement as a reduction of Bond Interest Expense.",
    "Example of Amortization of Premium on Bonds Payable": "Assume that a corporation issues bonds payable having a maturity value of $1,000,000 and receives a premium of $60,000. The bonds mature in 20 years and there was no accrued interest at the time the bonds are issued. The corporation will record the bonds as follows:",
    "Definition of Bond Premium": "Bond premium or premium on bonds occurs when the bond’s actual interest payments are greater than the interest payments expected by the market. The amount of the bond premium = (actual future interest payments + actual maturity amount) discounted by the market interest rate at the time of the bond sale. ",
    "Example of a Bond Premium": "A person would buy a bond at a premium (pay more than its maturity value) because the bond’s stated interest rate (and therefore the bond’s interest payments) will be greater than those expected by the current bond market. It is also possible that a bond investor will have no choice. For example, if the investor wants to purchase a bond with a high rating that matures in 8 years, perhaps only one bond will be available. If its stated interest rate is greater than the market interest rate on the day of the transaction, the investor either buys the bond at a premium or doesn’t buy a bond. You will find another example of bond premium at https://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-premium-on-bonds-payable",
    "Definition of Premium on Bonds Payable": "Premium on bonds payable (or bond premium) occurs when bonds payable are issued for an amount greater than their face or maturity amount. This is caused by the bonds having a stated interest rate that is higher than the market interest rate for similar bonds.",
    "Example of Premium on Bonds Payable": "Assume that a corporation prepares to issue bonds having a maturity value of $10,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6%. However, when the 6% bonds are actually sold, the market interest rate is 5.9%. Since these bonds will be paying investors more than the interest required by the market ($300,000 semiannually instead of $295,000 semiannually), the investors will pay more than $10,000,000 for the bonds. If we assume the investors pay $10,150,000 for the bonds, the corporation will record the transaction with a debit to Cash of $10,150,000; a credit to Bonds Payable of $10,000,000; and a credit of $150,000 to Premium on Bonds Payable (an adjunct liability account). Over the life of the bonds, the $150,000 premium is to be accounted for as a reduction of the corporation’s interest expense. This is done through the amortization of premium on bonds payable. The combination of 1) the unamortized credit balance in the account Premium on Bonds Payable, 2) the unamortized debit balance in the account Bond Issue Costs, and 3) the $10,000,000 credit balance in Bonds Payable is known as the book value or the carrying value of the bonds payable.",
    "Definition of Selling Price of Bond": "The selling price (or the market value) of a bond is the present value of the future contractual cash amounts that are going to be received by the owner of the bond. Expressed another way, the current selling price, present value, or market value of a bond = the total of the semiannual interest payments PLUS the amount that will be received when the bond matures both discounted by the current market interest rate. The total of these two present values = the market value or selling price of the bond.",
    "Example of Computing the Selling Price of a Bond": "Assume that a 6% bond having a face value $1,000,000 that will mature in 2 years is currently offered for sale. The interest paid on the bond is $30,000 every six months. The current market interest rate for a similar bond is 8%. The present value or current market value of this bond is:",
    "Definition of Yield to Maturity": "Yield to maturity is the total return that will be earned by someone who purchases a bond and holds it until its maturity date. The yield to maturity might also be referred to as:",
    "Example of Yield to Maturity": "Assume that a 5% $100,000 bond will mature in 5 years and will pay interest each June 1 and December 1. This means that the bondholder will be paid interest of $2,500 every six months until the bond matures. If the current market interest rate for this type of bond is 6%, the current market value of the 5% bond will be less than $100,000. Assume that the market value for this bond is only $95,735. (The market value is computed by discounting 1) the $2,500 of interest that will be received every six months for 5 years to its present value and 2) the $100,000 maturity amount that will be received at the end of 5 years. These cash amounts are discounted by the market interest rate of 3% per semiannual period for 10 semiannnual periods.) You can also view the yield to maturity of this bond as the following two components:",
    "Definition of Stated Interest Rate of a Bond": "The stated interest rate of a bond payable is the annual interest rate that is printed on the face of the bond and stated in the related legal document known as the bond indenture. The stated interest rate of a bond payable is also known as the face interest rate, nominal interest rate, contractual interest rate, and the coupon interest rate. The stated interest rate multiplied by the bond’s face amount (or par amount) determines the amount of cash that must be paid during each year. However, it is common for half of the annual amount to be paid at the end of each 6-month period (semiannually).  Generally, a bond’s stated interest rate is fixed (does not change) for the life of the bond. As a result, the  interest payments form an ordinary annuity for the life of the bond. While the interest payments are a constant amount, the market interest rate for the bond is likely to be continually changing. A change in the market interest rate will cause the present value of the interest payments (and the present value of the maturity amount) to change in the opposite direction. For instance, when the market interest rate increases the present value of the existing bond will decrease. When the market interest rate decreases, the present value of an existing bond will increase. (The there can be some limits to the amount of the change.)",
    "Example of a Stated Interest Rate on a Bond": "Assume a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds having a stated interest rate of 6% and maturing in 10 years. This means that the corporation agrees to pay interest of $300,000 semiannually ($10,000,000 X 6% X 1/2 year) at the end of each of the 20 semiannual periods. At the time the bonds mature (at end of the 10 years) the corporation agrees to also pay $10,000,000. Typically, these cash amounts will not change even if there are significant changes in the market interest rates.",
    "Definition of Actual or Real Interest Rate on a Bond Investment": "The actual or real interest rate on a bond payable is also known as effective interest rate, yield to maturity, yield, and market interest rate. This rate can be calculated by discounting the bond’s future cash amounts (semiannual interest payments and the maturity amount) back to the amount of cash paid to buy the bond (the present value).",
    "Example of Actual or Real Interest Rate on a Bond Investment": "Assume an investor can purchase a $300,000 7% bond that matures 5 years later for $287,832. The investor will receive the following cash flows: semiannual interest of $10,500 at the end of each of the 10 six-month periods + $300,000 at the end of the 10th six-month period. The actual interest rate to be earned by the investor (the bond’s yield to maturity) is the interest rate that will discount the interest stream (an ordinary annuity) and the maturity amount (a lump sum) to $287,832. This can be done with software, a financial calculator, or via trial and error using present value tables. In our example, the actual interest rate earned by the investor is 4% per semiannual period or 8% annually.  The reason that the bond can be purchased at a discount from its face and maturity amount, is that the current market interest rate is now 8% and the bond is paying only 7%. Because the market interest rate is more than the bond’s stated interest rate, the market value of the bond is less than the maturity amount.",
    "Definition of Amortize Premium, Discount, and Issue Costs": "With regards to bonds payable, the term amortize means to systematically allocate the discount on bonds payable, the premium on bonds payable, and bond issue costs to Interest Expense over the remaining life of the bonds. (Bonds are likely to mature 10 years or more after they are issued.) The most precise way to amortize these amounts is to use the effective interest rate method. However, the straight-line method of amortization, which is less precise and simpler is also acceptable.",
    "Examples of Amortizing Discount on Bonds and Bond Issue Costs": "Assume that on January 1, a corporation issues $2,000,000 of 6% Bonds Payable which mature at the end of 10 years. Because the market interest rate for similar bonds was higher than 6%, the corporation received only $1,940,000 from investors. The resulting difference of $60,000 must be recorded in the contra-liability account Discount on Bonds Payable. The corporation must also record the bond issue costs (legal, auditing and filing fees) of $24,000 in the contra-liability account Bond Issue Costs. On each June 30 and December 31, the corporation must pay interest of $60,000 ($2,000,000 X 6% X 1/2 year). The corporation must also amortize the bond discount and the bond issue costs. The following are pertinent journal entries for each June 30 and December 31 (assuming only calendar year financial statements are issued and the straight-line method of amortization is used):",
    "Definition of Book Value of Bonds Payable": "The book value of bonds payable is also known as the carrying value of bonds payable. The book value of bonds payable is the net or combination of the following amounts, all of which are bond-related liability accounts:",
    "Example of Book Value of Bonds Payable": "Assume that as of December 31, the amortizations are up to date and the general ledger accounts had the following balances:",
    "Definition of Ordinary Annuity": "In accounting, an ordinary annuity refers to a series of identical cash amounts with each amount occurring at the end of equal time intervals. Another term for ordinary annuity is annuity in arrears.",
    "Example of Ordinary Annuity": "The series of semiannual interest payments that are part of a bond payable is an example of an ordinary annuity.  A 10-year bond with a face value of $10 million and a stated interest rate of 6% will include an ordinary annuity consisting of the required interest payments of $300,000 at the end of each of the 20 six-month time intervals. Another example of an ordinary annuity is a mortgage loan having a fixed interest rate and a series of equal monthly payments. For instance, a 15-year mortgage loan will result in an ordinary annuity of 180 equal monthly payments with the first payment due approximately 30 days after the loan is made.",
    "Definition of Face Value of a Bond Payable": "The face value of a bond payable is the amount printed on the bond. The face value is also referred to as the following:",
    "Example of Face Value of a Bond Payable": "Assume that a corporation issues a bond payable having a face value of $1,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6% per year. This means that the bond issuer is obliged to pay the following amounts:",
    "Definition of Dividend Payment to Stockholders": "A dividend payment to stockholders is usually a cash payment which reduces the corporation’s asset cash and the corporation’s stockholders’ equity. There are actually two steps required for a corporation to make a dividend payment:",
    "Example of Recording a Dividend Payment to Stockholders": "On the date that the board of directors declares the dividend, the stockholders’ equity account Retained Earnings is debited for the total amount of the dividend that will be paid and the current liability account Dividends Payable is credited for the same amount. (Some corporations will debit the temporary account Dividends instead of debiting Retained Earnings. Then at the end of the year, the Dividends account is closed to Retained Earnings.)  The second entry occurs on the date of the payment to the stockholders. On that date the current liability account Dividends Payable is debited and the asset account Cash is credited.",
    "Definition of Public Sector": "Public sector refers to government-owned organizations and government-provided services.",
    "Definition of Private Sector": "Private sector refers to:",
    "Example of Private Sector": "Companies owned by individuals are part of the private sector. Even the largest corporation with its common stock publicly-traded on the New York Stock Exchange is part of the private sector. ",
    "Definition of Stockholder": "A stockholder or shareholder is the owner of shares of a corporation’s common or preferred stock.",
    "Definition of Stakeholder": "A stakeholder is anyone that has an interest or is affected by a corporation or other organization. In other words, a stockholder isn’t the only party having a stake in the corporation. ",
    "Examples of Stakeholders": "The stakeholders in a corporation include its: stockholders, creditors, employees, families of the employees,  suppliers, customers, community, and others. A example of an organization that does not have stockholders is a state university. Even though it does not have stockholders, the university will have the following stakeholders: students, students’ families, alumni, professors, administrators, businesses, state taxpayers, the local community, the state community, society in general, custodians, suppliers, etc.",
    "Definition of Cost of Capital": "The cost of capital is the weighted-average, after-tax cost of a corporation’s long-term debt, preferred stock (if any), and the stockholders’ equity associated with common stock. The cost of capital is expressed as a percentage and it is often used to compute the net present value of the cash flows in a proposed investment. It is also considered to be the minimum after-tax internal rate of return to be earned on new investments. For a profitable U.S. corporation, the costs of bonds and other long-term loans are usually the least expensive components of the cost of capital. One reason is that the interest is deductible for income taxes. For example, a corporation paying 6% on its loans may have an after-tax cost of 4% when its combined federal and state income tax rate is 33%. On the other hand, the dividends paid on the corporation’s preferred and common stock are not tax deductible. The cost of common stock (paid-in capital and retained earnings) is considered to be the most expensive component of the cost of capital because of the risks involved.",
    "Example of Cost of Capital": "Assume that a corporation has the following:",
    "Definition of Public Companies": "Public companies are those businesses owned by individuals (and not by a government).",
    "Definition of Publicly-Held Corporation": "If a public company is a corporation whose stock is traded on a stock exchange, it is said that the stock is publicly traded or that the corporation is a publicly-held corporation or a publicly-traded corporation.",
    "Definition of Capital Stock": "Capital stock refers to the shares of ownership that have been issued by a corporation. The amount received by the corporation when its shares of capital stock were issued is reported as paid-in capital within the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.",
    "Examples of Capital Stock": "Capital stock is the combination of a corporation’s common stock and preferred stock. Common stock is issued by every U.S. corporation. A small percentage of corporations also issue preferred stock. The stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet will list the types and amounts of the capital stock.",
    "Definition of a Stock Split": "A stock split usually increases the number of shares of a corporation’s common stock with the intention of reducing the market price of each share of stock.",
    "Example of a Stock Split": "Assume that a corporation’s common stock has risen to $150 per share and there are 100,000 shares issued and outstanding. The board of directors would like the shares of common stock to be trading near $50. To achieve this, the board approved a 3-for-1 stock split. After the stock split there are 300,000 shares issued and outstanding. If an individual stockholder owned 10,000 shares or 10% of the 100,000 shares before the stock split, the stockholder will own 30,000 shares or 10% of the 300,000 shares after the stock split.",
    "Journal Entries for a Stock Split": "The only journal entry needed for a stock split is a memo entry to note that the number of shares has changed and that the par value per share has changed (if the stock has a par value). However, a typical journal entry (one with a debit and a credit) is not needed since the total dollar amounts for the par value and other components of paid-in capital and stockholders’ equity are not changed with a stock split.",
    "Definition of Preferred Stock": "Preferred stock is a type of capital stock issued by some corporations in addition to its common stock. Preferred stock is also known as preference stock. The word “preferred” refers to the dividends paid by the corporation and to the liquidation of the corporation (if that were to occur). In exchange for this preferential treatment, the preferred stockholders (shareholders) generally will never receive more than the preferred stock’s stated fixed dividend. The preferential treatment for dividends means that preferred stockholders will receive their dividends before the common stockholders are to receive any dividend.  Preferred stock is relatively rare since corporations will use debt in addition to its common stock.",
    "Example of Preferred Stock": "Assume that a stockholder owns 100 shares of a corporation’s 8% $100 par preferred stock. Each year, this stockholder must receive dividends on the preferred stock of $800 (8% X $100 = $8 per share X 100 shares) before the common stockholders are allowed to receive any cash dividends for the year. Unless the preferred stock has a participating feature, this preferred stockholder will never receive more than $8 per share no matter how successful the corporation becomes. The preferred stock could have any of the following features: cumulative, convertible, callable, participating, and more. Since the dividend on preferred stock is usually a fixed amount forever, once the preferred stock is issued its market value is likely to change in the opposite direction of inflation. The higher the rate of inflation, the less valuable are the fixed dividend amounts. If the inflation rate declines, the value of the preferred stock is likely to increase, but no higher than the preferred stock’s call price.",
    "Examples of Dividends": "Jones Corporation has 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding. Each quarter, the board of directors declares a $1 dividend per share of common stock. This results in a debit of $100,000 to Retained Earnings and a credit of $100,000 to Cash. Next month, Jones Corporation will be declaring a 10% stock dividend. This means that the corporation will distribute 10,000 (100,000 shares X 10%) new shares of common stock to its stockholders. If the market price of a share of common stock will be $25, the entry to record the stock dividend will be a debit of $250,000 to Retained Earnings and a credit to a paid-in capital account such as Common Stock. It is important to note that dividends are not expenses and therefore are not reported on the corporation’s income statement.",
    "Examples of Stockholders": "An owner of a corporation’s shares of common stock is referred to as a common stockholder. The common stockholders elect the corporation’s board of directors and will vote on certain transactions such as merging the corporation with another corporation. Generally, it is the common stockholders who become wealthy when a corporation becomes increasingly successful. In addition to common stock, some corporations also issue preferred stock. The owners of the shares\nof preferred stock are known as preferred stockholders (or preferred shareholders). The preferred stockholders usually accept a fixed cash dividend that will be paid by the corporation before the common stockholders are paid a dividend. In exchange for this preferential treatment of dividends, the preferred stockholders typically forego the potential financial gains that the common stockholders might enjoy. The amounts paid to the corporation by the original stockholders are reported as paid-in (or contributed) capital within the stockholders’ equity section of the corporation’s balance sheet.",
    "Declaring a Dividend": "When the board of directors declares a dividend, it will result in a debit to Retained Earnings and a credit to a liability such as Dividends Payable. When the corporation pays the dividend, Dividends Payable will be debited and Cash will be credited. Since Retained Earnings is a component of stockholders’ equity, the declaration and payment of a dividend reduces the corporation’s assets and its stockholders’ equity.",
    "Definition of Dividends in Arrears": "Dividends in arrears exist when a corporation has:",
    "Example of Paying Dividends in Arrears": "Assume that a corporation has cumulative preferred stock with an annual dividend of $10,000 and it has omitted the dividends for the past three years. Therefore, there are $30,000 of dividends in arrears. The corporation decides to pay dividends of $60,000. The dividends will be paid as follows:",
    "Definition of a Stock Dividend": "A stock dividend is a dividend consisting of additional shares of stock. Assume that before a corporation declares a stock dividend, it has 25,000 shares of common stock outstanding with each of its 25 stockholders holding 1,000 shares. After a 10% stock dividend, each stockholder will have 1,100 shares and the corporation will have 27,500 shares outstanding. This means that before and after the stock dividend, each stockholder owns 4% of the corporation (1/25 and 1.1/27.5). Basically, the corporation has not changed, it simply increased everyone’s number of shares of stock proportionately. ",
    "Definition of a Cash Dividend": "A cash dividend is a distribution of part of a corporation’s cash. If a corporation has 25,000 shares of common stock outstanding and it declares and pays a cash dividend of $3 per share, the corporation will distribute $75,000 of its cash to the common stockholders. In addition to reducing the corporation’s cash balance, it reduces the corporation’s retained earnings, which is part of its stockholders’ equity.",
    "Reasons for a Stock Dividend": "A corporation might issue a stock dividend instead of paying a cash dividend for the following reasons:",
    "Definition of Premium on Common Stock": "If a corporation’s common stock has a par value and the corporation receives more than the par value when issuing a new share of the stock, the difference is sometimes referred to as the premium on common stock.  The premium on common stock may appear on the balance sheet as paid-in capital in excess of par value–common stock or additional paid-in capital.",
    "Example of Premium on Common Stock": "Assume that a corporation’s common stock has a par value of $0.10 per share. If the corporation receives $20 when it issues an additional share of stock, the difference of $19.90 will be recorded in a separate stockholders’ equity account entitled Premium on Common Stock or Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Value–Common Stock .",
    "Definition of Arrears": "In accounting, the term arrears will be used in the following situations:",
    "Example of Arrears": "Assume a corporation has 10,000 shares of 6% $100 cumulative preferred stock. Since the corporation has a limited amount of cash available, the board of directors did not declare any dividends on the preferred stock this year. In other words, the corporation has dividends in arrears of $60,000 (6% X $100 X 10,000). The preferred stock’s dividends in arrears must be disclosed in the corporation’s notes to its financial statements. This notifies investors and others that these past, omitted dividends must be paid before any dividends can be declared and paid. Typically, the monthly payments required for automobile and real estate loans are annuities in arrears. For example, if a company borrows $50,000 on September 30, the first of the monthly payments will be due on October 31, the second payment will be due on November 30, and so on.",
    "Definition of Deficit Within Stockholders’ Equity": "The term deficit is used within the stockholders’ equity section of a corporation’s balance sheet in place of retained earnings if the balance in the corporation’s retained earnings account is a debit balance. In other words, the corporation has a negative amount of retained earnings.",
    "Example of Deficit Within Stockholders’ Equity": "Assume a corporation was formed just over three years ago. In its first year, the corporation had a positive net income of $40,000. In its second year it had a positive net income of $75,000. As a result, the corporation’s balance sheet at the end of the second year will report Retained earnings $115,000. In its third year the corporation had a net loss of $195,000. Therefore, at the end of the third year the stockholders’ equity section of the corporation’s balance sheet will report Deficit ($80,000) in place of using the words retained earnings.",
    "Example of a Dividend": "Assume a corporation declares and pays a cash dividend of $2 on its 300,000 shares of common stock outstanding. This $600,000 distribution of cash will reduce the balances in two of the corporation’s balance sheet accounts:",
    "Definition of a Variance": "In accounting the term variance usually refers to the difference between an actual amount and a planned or budgeted amount. For example, if a company’s budget for repairs expense is $50,000 and the actual amount ends up being $45,000 or $63,000, there will be a variance of $5,000 or $13,000 respectively. Similarly, if a company has budgeted its revenues to be $280,000 and the actual revenues end up being $271,000 or $291,000, there will be a variance of $9,000 or $11,000 respectively.",
    "When is a Variance Favorable": "A favorable variance indicates that the variance or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts was good or favorable for the company’s profits. In other words, this variance will be one reason why the amount of the company’s actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.",
    "Favorable Expense Variance": "For example, if supplies expense was budgeted to be $30,000 but the actual supplies expense ends up being $28,000, the $2,000 variance is favorable because having fewer expenses than were budgeted was good for the company’s profits. It is one reason why the company’s actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.",
    "Favorable Revenue Variance": "If a company had budgeted its revenues to be $200,000 and the actual revenues end up being $208,000, the company will have a favorable variance of $8,000. The variance is favorable because having the actual revenues being more than the amount budgeted is good for the company’s profits. It will also be a factor why the company’s actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits. ",
    "Definition of Stock Split": "A stock split usually refers to a corporation dividing its existing number of shares of common stock into a greater number of shares. For instance, a  corporation with 100,000 shares of stock before a 2-for-1 stock split will have 200,000 shares after the split. An investor owning 100 shares before the stock is split 2-for-1 will have 200 shares after the split.",
    "Stock Price After a Stock Split": "Since the corporation is not changed (total assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity remain the same) by the stock split, the change in the number of shares will cause a change in the market price of each share. For example, if a share had been trading at $50 before a 2-for-1 stock split, a share should be trading at $25 after the stock split. If the corporation had 100,000 shares of common stock trading at $50 per share before a 2-for-1 stock split, the total market value of the shares would have been $5 million. After the 2-for-1 stock split, the corporation’s market value will also be $5 million (200,000 shares X $25 per share). This is the same for each investor. For example, the 10 shares owned by a small investor had a market value of $500 (10 shares X $50). After the 2-for-1 stock split, the small investor shares will also have a market value of $500 (20 shares X $25).",
    "Why Stock Splits Occur": "Stock splits such as 2-for-1, 3-for-2, 4-for-1, etc. (which increase the number of shares) are intended to decrease the market price of each share of a corporation’s common stock. Often the purpose is to allow small investors to purchase 100 shares of the corporation’s stock at a more reasonable total cost. Reverse stock splits such as 1-for-10 (which decrease the number of shares) are intended to increase the market price of each share of stock. Usually the purpose is to minimize the number of small investors. To illustrate, assume that a corporation had 800,000 shares of stock that were trading at $2 per share (resulting in a total market value of $1.6 million). After a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, there will be only 80,000 shares trading at $20 per share (which also results in a total market value of $1.6 million). Prior to the reverse stock split, small investors were able to purchase 100 shares for just $200. After the stock split, an investor will need $2,000 (100 shares X $20) to purchase 100 shares.",
    "Definition of Cumulative Preferred Stock": "Cumulative preferred stock is a type of preferred stock for which any omitted dividends must be paid before the corporation is allowed to pay a dividend on its shares of common stock.  Typically, the corporation’s board of directors will not declare a dividend they will be omitting. Therefore, the amount of these past omitted dividends that remain unpaid must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The past omitted dividends on the cumulative preferred stock are referred to as dividends in arrears.  ",
    "Examples of Cumulative Preferred Stock": "Assume that a corporation has issued and outstanding 10,000 shares of 6% cumulative preferred stock with a par value of $100. This means that the corporation must declare and pay $60,000 ($6 per share X 10,000 shares) in dividends to its cumulative preferred stockholders before the corporation can pay any dividend to its common stockholders.  If the corporation declares and pays only $25,000 in dividends to the cumulative preferred stockholders, the corporation will have $35,000 ($60,000 minus $25,000) of dividends in arrears that must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.",
    "Definition of NPV": "The net present value (NPV) method or model discounts all of the cash inflows and outflows by a specified interest rate. The net (or combined) amount of all of the discounted amounts is the net present value. If the net present value is $0, the project is expected to earn exactly the specified rate. If the net present value is a positive amount, the project will be earning more than the specified interest rate. A negative net present value means the project is expected to earn less than the specified interest rate.",
    "Example of NPV": "Assume that a company makes a cash investment of $500,000 in a project that is expected to provide future cash inflows of $100,000 at the end of each year for 10 years. The future cash receipts of $100,000 at the end of each year for 10 years needs to be discounted to their present value. If the future cash amounts are discounted by 14% per year compounded annually (the company’s required return), it will result in a present value of approximately $522,000. The $522,000 of present value coming in minus the $500,000 of present value going out results is a positive net present value of $22,000. In other words, the company will earn slightly more than 14% per year on its $500,000 investment.",
    "Definition of Present Value (PV)": "Present value or PV is the result of discounting one or more future amounts to the present. The greater the discount rate, the smaller the present value.",
    "Examples of Present Value": "A cash amount of $10,000 received at the end of 5 years will have a present value (PV) of $6,210 when the $10,000 is discounted at 10% compounded annually. If the $10,000 is discounted at 12% compounded annually, the present value will be $5,670.",
    "Definition of Net Present Value (NPV)": "Net present value is the result of discounting all of the cash inflows and outflows and then combining all of their present values. This means that the original outflow (often the investment made at the present time) is a deduction from the other present values. A positive net present value indicates that an investment is earning more than the discount rate. A negative net present value indicates an investment is earning less than the discount rate, but may be earning a positive rate. For example, if the cash flows are discounted by 12%, a slightly negative NPV could mean that the investment is earning 11%.  ",
    "Examples of Net Present Value": "Assume that an investment of $5,000 today will result in one cash receipt of $10,000 at the end of 5 years. If the investor requires a 10% annual return compounded annually, the net present value (NPV) of the investment is $1,210. This is the result of combining the present value of the cash inflow $6,210 (from the example above) and the $5,000 (which is the present of the $5,000 paid today). Assuming the same information, except that the rate for discounting the cash amounts is 12%, the net present value (NPV) is $670. This is the $5,670 present value of the cash inflow combined with the present value of the $5,000 cash outflow.",
    "Definition of Implicit Interest Rate": "An implicit interest rate is one that is not stated explicitly.",
    "Example of Implicit Interest Rate": "Assume that I lend you $4,623 and you agree to repay me by giving me $1,000 at the end of each year for 6 years. Obviously you are paying interest. However, our agreement did not specify any interest, nor did it state an interest rate. To find the interest rate that is implicit in this arrangement, you need to carry out what’s known as a present value calculation. This can be done through the use of a financial calculator, software, an online calculator, or present value tables. The following format is helpful when using a present value of an ordinary annuity (PVOA) table:",
    "Definition of Hurdle Rate": "In capital budgeting, the term hurdle rate is the minimum rate that a company wants to earn when investing in a project. Therefore, the hurdle rate is also referred to as the company’s required rate of return or target rate. For a company to further consider a project, its internal rate of return must equal or exceed the hurdle rate. The hurdle rate is also used to discount a project’s future cash flows to its net present value.",
    "Example of Hurdle Rate": "The absolute minimum hurdle rate should be the company’s cost of capital (a blend of the cost of debt and the cost of equity). However, the hurdle rate is usually larger than the cost of capital when the company has many investment opportunities and for projects that have a higher level of risk.",
    "Definition of Non-discount Method of Capital Budgeting": "A non-discount method of capital budgeting is one that does not consider the time value of money. In other words, all dollars earned in the future are assumed to have the same value as today’s dollars.",
    "Examples of Non-discount Methods of Capital Budgeting": "One example of a non-discount method is the payback method, since it does not consider the time value of money. The payback method simply computes the number of years it will take for an investment to return cash that is equal to the amount invested. The computed number of years is referred to as the payback period. To illustrate, assume that a company invests $100,000 today in a project that is expected to generate cash of $50,000 for two years followed by $10,000 per year for four additional years. Its payback period is two years ($50,000 + $50,000).  Assume that another investment of $100,000 generates cash of $20,000 per year for two years and then provides cash of $40,000 per year for six additional years, its payback period is approximately 3.5 years ($20,000 + $20,000 + $40,000 + half of $40,000). The payback method answers only one question: How long before the cash invested is returned? The payback method does not address which investment is more profitable. Note from our examples that the payback method not only ignores the time value of money, it ignores all of the cash received after the payback period. Another example of a non-discount method in capital budgeting is the accounting rate of return method, which is similar to the return on investment (ROI). [To overcome the above shortcomings, capital budgeting should include calculations that recognize the time value of money. These include (1) the net present value, and (2) the internal rate of return. These calculations involve discounting the future cash flows since a dollar in the distant future will be less valuable than a dollar in the near future, and both of those dollars have less value than a dollar today.]",
    "Definition of IRR": "The internal rate of return (IRR) method or model determines the interest rate that discounts all cash inflows and cash outflows to a net present value of $0. In other words, the IRR model provides you with the true, effective interest rate earned on a project after taking into consideration the time value of money and the periods when the various cash amounts flow in and out.  If you use present value tables to calculate the internal rate of return, it will require some trial and error (iterations) to find the exact rate the project is earning. Software, financial calculators, and online calculators provide a quicker and more accurate answer.",
    "Comparison of IRR and NPV": "Both IRR and NPV use a company’s cash inflows and cash outflows that are discounted to a present value. (Neither use the accrual accounting income statement amounts.) IRR calculates the true interest rate earned based on the cash flows. NPV calculates the present value amount based on a stated/specified interest rate.",
    "Definition of Internal Rate of Return": "The internal rate of return is the interest rate that will discount an investment’s future cash amounts to be equal to cash paid at the beginning of the investment. In capital budgeting, the internal rate of return results in an investment having a net present value of zero. The internal rate of return is one of the tools in capital budgeting that considers both of the following:",
    "Example of Internal Rate of Return": "Assume that a company is considering an investment that will provide net cash inflows of $1,000 at the end of each year for five years. The amount of cash that the company must pay at the beginning of the investment is $3,600. Someone must determine the interest rate that will discount the five $1,000 future cash receipts so that their present value at the time of the investment will equal $3,600. This is best done through software or manually (trial and error). In our example, the internal rate of return is approximately 12%.",
    "Definition of Net Present Value": "Net present value is the combination of 1) the present value of cash inflows, and 2) the present value of the cash outflows. To arrive at these present value amounts, the future cash flows are discounted by a specified interest rate. The specified rate could be the investor’s cost of capital or it could be another hurdle rate that must be earned. Advantages of using the net present value to evaluate investments include the following:",
    "Example of Net Present Value": "Assume a company is considering investing $100,000 today in a project that provides $30,000 at the end of each year for 5 years. The company’s hurdle rate is 20%. The present value of the $100,000 cash outflow is $100,000 (since it occurs at the present time). The present value of the $20,000 cash inflows occurring at the end of 7 years is $89,730 ($30,000 X 2.991). Therefore, the combination of the present values of the cash flows results in a net present value (NPV) of negative $10,270 (negative PV of $100,000 + positive PV of  $89,730). The negative NPV means the investment will be rejected. However, the investment is expected to provide a return of approximately 15%.",
    "Definition of Break-even Point in Sales Dollars": "The break-even point in sales dollars can be calculated by dividing a company’s total fixed expenses by the company’s contribution margin ratio.",
    "Definition of Contribution Margin Ratio": "The contribution margin ratio is the percentage of sales revenues, service revenues, or selling price remaining after subtracting all of the variable costs and variable expenses.  Expressed another way, the contribution margin ratio is the percentage of revenues that is available to cover a company’s fixed costs, fixed expenses, and profit. Note that the contribution margin ratio is not the same as the gross margin ratio or gross profit percentage. Further, the contribution margin ratio cannot be computed from the amounts appearing on a company’s external income statement.",
    "Example of Break-even Point in Sales Dollars": "To illustrate the break-even point in sales dollars, let’s assume that a company has fixed expenses of $100,000 per year. The variable expenses are estimated to be 80% of the net sales. This means that the contribution margin ratio is 20% of net sales. Since only 20% of the sales dollars are available to cover the $100,000 fixed expenses, the company will need to have $500,000 of net sales ($100,000 divided by 20%). At $500,000 of net sales, the amount of variable expenses will be $400,000 (80% X $500,000). That leaves $100,000 to cover the $100,000 of fixed expenses. Hence, at $500,000 of net sales the company will be at the break-even point, which is the point where sales will be equal to all of the company’s expenses. This is the point where the net income will be zero.",
    "Definition of Break-even Point": "The break-even point is the volume of sales in units or in dollars that is equal to a company’s total expenses (including the cost of goods sold). In other words, it is the level of sales where the income statement will report a net income of exactly zero.",
    "Examples of Break-even Point": "To illustrate the break-even point, let’s assume that a company’s fixed expenses are $480,000 for a year, its variable expenses (variable manufacturing, variable SG&A, variable interest) average $8 per unit of product, and its selling prices average $20 per unit. The result is an average contribution margin of $12 per unit and an average contribution margin ratio of 60% ($12 divided by the average selling price of $20). Using this information, the company will have:",
    "Definition of Cost Behavior": "Cost behavior is an indicator of how a cost will change in total when there is a change in some activity. In cost accounting and managerial accounting, three types of cost behavior are usually discussed:",
    "Examples of Cost Behavior": "An example of a variable cost is the cost of flour for a bakery that produces artisan breads. The greater the number of loaves produced, the greater the total cost of the flour used by the bakery. An example of a fixed cost is the depreciation and insurance on the bakery facility and equipment. Regardless of the quantity of artisan breads produced in a month, the total amount of depreciation and insurance cost for the month will remain the same. An example of a mixed cost or semivariable cost is the bakery’s cost of natural gas. Some of the monthly gas bill is a flat fee charged by the utility and some of the gas bill is the cost of heating the building. These two components of the gas bill are fixed since they will not change when the bakery produces more or less loaves of its bread. However, a third component of the gas bill is the cost of operating the ovens. This component is a variable cost since it will increase when the ovens must operate for a longer time in order to produce additional loaves of bread.",
    "Definition of Margin of Safety": "In break-even analysis, the term margin of safety indicates the amount of sales that are above the break-even point. In other words, the margin of safety indicates the amount by which a company’s sales could decrease before the company will have no profit.",
    "Example of Margin of Safety": "Let’s assume that a company currently sells 3,000 units of its only product. The company has estimated that its break-even point is 2,800 units. Therefore, the company’s margin of safety is 200 units.",
    "Definition of Mixed Costs": "Mixed costs are partially a fixed cost and partially a variable cost. Mixed costs are also known as semivariable costs.",
    "Example of Mixed Costs": "An example of a mixed cost is the electricity used in a manufacturing facility. A part of each monthly electricity bill is a variable cost since more electricity is used when more machines are working to manufacture more products. However, part of each monthly electricity bill is fixed because this part of the bill does not change because of the number of products manufactured. For instance, the cost of the air conditioning and air purifying occurs continuously. In addition, the electric bill includes a fixed charge based on the manufacturer’s peak day electricity usage that occurred in the prior 12 months. ",
    "Direct Costs vs. Indirect Costs": "The terms direct costs and indirect costs could be referring to a product, a department, a machine, geographic market, etc. (which are referred to as cost objects).  If the cost object is a company’s product that is being manufactured, the cost of the product’s raw materials and the cost of the employees on the assembly line are direct costs since they are directly traceable to the product. However, the cost of the other employees in the manufacturing facility (maintenance, clean-up, material handlers, etc.) and the other costs of the manufacturing facility (depreciation, property tax, maintenance, heat, and insurance) are indirect product costs since these costs must be allocated to the product. These indirect product costs are also known as manufacturing overhead costs, factory overhead costs, and burden. If the cost object is the company’s production department, the depreciation of the production equipment and the salary of the manager of the production department are direct costs of the production department. However, the depreciation, heat, and maintenance, etc. of the building containing the production department (which also includes the warehouse for materials, the warehouse for finished goods, the shipping department, and quality control department) are indirect costs of the production department, since they must be allocated to the production department.",
    "Fixed Costs vs. Variable Costs": "If the cost object is a product being manufactured, it is likely that direct materials are a variable cost. (If one pound of material is used for each unit, then this direct cost is variable.) However, the product’s indirect manufacturing costs are likely a combination of fixed costs and variable costs. For instance, if the managers within the manufacturing facility but not on the assembly line are paid salaries which total $20,000 per month, this cost is a fixed indirect product cost. The equipment maintenance expense and the temporary shipping clerks could be a variable indirect product cost, since this cost will vary with production volume. If the cost object is the production department, the direct and indirect department costs are likely to be partly fixed and partly variable. For example, the production department has it own electric meter to measure the electricity used to operate its equipment. Therefore, the electricity cost is a direct production department cost that is variable since it changes with the volume of products manufactured. On the other hand the salaries of the production department supervisors are a direct production department cost that is fixed.",
    "Examples of Causes for an Increase in a Break-even Point": "Some of the reasons why a company’s break-even point will increase are:",
    "Example of Contribution Margin Ratio": "Assume that a company manufactures and sells a single product and has the following information:",
    "Definition of High-Low Method": "The high-low method is a simple technique for determining the variable cost rate and the amount of fixed costs that are part of what’s referred to as a mixed cost or semivariable cost. The high-low method uses two sets of numbers: 1) the total dollars of the mixed cost that occurred at the highest volume of activity, and 2) the total dollars of the mixed cost that occurred at the lowest volume of activity. It is assumed that at both points of activity the total amount of fixed costs is the same. Therefore, the change in the total costs is assumed to be the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity. Prior to doing the high-low calculation, it is important to plot or graph all of the data available to be certain that the two sets of numbers being used are indeed representative.",
    "Example of High-Low Method": "Assume that the cost of electricity at a small manufacturing facility is a mixed cost since the company has only one electricity meter for air quality, cooling, lighting, and for its production equipment. The company wants to know the rate at which its electricity cost changes when the number of machine hours change. This amount is the variable cost rate. The part of the electric bill that does not change with the number of machine hours is known as the fixed cost. Let’s assume that the company is billed monthly for its electricity usage. The cost of electricity was $18,000 in the month when its highest activity was 120,000 machine hours (MHs). (Be sure to use the MHs that occurred between the meter reading dates appearing on the bill.) The cost of electricity was $16,000 in the month when its lowest activity was 100,000 MHs. This shows that the total monthly cost of electricity changed by $2,000 ($18,000 vs. $16,000) when the number of MHs changed by 20,000 (120,000 vs. 100,000). In other words, the variable cost rate was $0.10 per machine hour ($2,000/20,000 MHs). Continuing with this example, if the total electricity cost was $18,000 when there were 120,000 MHs, the variable portion is assumed to have been $12,000 (120,000 MHs times $0.10). Since the total electricity cost was $18,000 and the variable cost was calculated to be $12,000, the fixed cost of electricity for the month must have been the $6,000. If we use the lowest level of activity, the total cost of $16,000 would include $10,000 of variable cost (100,000 MHs times $0.10) with the remainder of $6,000 being the fixed cost for the month.",
    "Definition of Fixed Expense": "A fixed expense is an expense whose total amount does not change when there is an increase in an activity such as sales or production. The words within a relevant or reasonable range of activity are normally added to the definition because at an extremely high volume or low volume, a change will likely occur. ",
    "Examples of Fixed Expenses": "Let’s assume that a retailer’s monthly rent is $2,000. If the rent will remain at $2,000 whether the monthly sales are $15,000 or $30,000, we will say that the rent is a fixed expense. (Of course, if sales triple or drop to be 20% of the normal amount, the rent will likely have to change. Nonetheless, the present rent of $2,000 is considered to be a fixed expense since the extreme conditions are outside of the relevant range for short-term analyses.) Other examples of expenses that are likely to be fixed within a reasonable range of retail sales include:",

    "Examples of Ways to Reduce the Break-even Point": "The break-even point will be reduced by any (or any combination) of the following:",
    "Examples of Reducing the Break-even Point": "A company’s break-even point will be reduced by the following:",
    "Definition of Sales Mix": "Sales mix is the relative proportion or ratio of a business’s products that are sold. Sales mix is important because a company’s products usually have different degrees of profitability. Sales mix also applies to service businesses since the services provided will likely have different levels of profitability.",
    "Example of Sales Mix": "Let’s assume that an automobile company plans to sell 100,000 units in the current year. The planned sales mix is 20,000 units of very-low-profit models + 50,000 units of medium-profit models + 30,000 units of very-high-profit models. In other words, the planned sales mix is 20%, 50%, 30%. With this volume and sales mix the company is planning to have a small operating loss. Now let’s assume that the total units actually sold were only 95,000 units. Having 5,000 fewer units sold could mean a huge operating loss. However, the company’s loss (or profit) depends on the actual sales mix. What if the actual sales indicates that 15% of 95,000 units sold were the very-low-profit units, 45% of the sales were the medium-profit units were sold, and 40% of the sales were the very-high-profit units. In other words, this more favorable sales mix (15-45-40 instead of 20-50-30) could result in an operating profit (instead of the planned loss) even with 5,000 fewer units sold.",
    "Definition of Marginal Cost": "Marginal cost is a manufacturer’s cost to produce one more unit of product. In other words, marginal cost is the change in total costs when one additional unit is produced. The marginal income tax cost (or tax rate) is the income tax cost of earning the next dollar of taxable income. The marginal cost is important because a company’s fixed costs are unlikely to change when one more unit is produced or one additional unit of activity takes place. Therefore, the marginal cost is typically less than the average cost.",
    "Example of Marginal Cost": "Assume that a company’s total cost of producing 10,000 units of product is $50,000. When the company produces 10,001 units, the company’s total cost is $50,002. Therefore, the marginal cost of producing unit #10,001 is $2. The reason that the marginal cost was $2 instead of the previous average cost of $5 ($50,000 divided by 10,000 units) is that some costs did not increase when the additional unit was produced. For example, fixed costs such as the actual salaries, depreciation, and property taxes are unlikely to increase because one more unit was produced.",
    "Definition of Elastic Demand": "Elastic demand is the situation in which demand for a product or service is sensitive to price changes.  Elastic demand is a major concern for a manufacturer that attempts to set a product’s price based on the product’s costs. For instance, if the manufacturer’s production and sales have declined and it fails to cut fixed costs, the manufacturer could be worse off by increasing selling prices. It could even lead to a death spiral.",
    "Examples of Elastic Demand": "If the selling price of a product is increased, the number of units sold will decrease. If the selling price of a product is decreased, the number of units sold will increase. Elastic demand is also referred to as the price elasticity of demand. [Inelastic demand means that the demand for a product is not sensitive to price changes.]",
    "Definition of Coefficient of Correlation": "In simple linear regression analysis, the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient) is a statistic which indicates an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient of correlation is represented by “r” and it has a range of -1.00 to +1.00.  When the coefficient of correlation is a positive amount, such as +0.80, it means the dependent variable is increasing when the independent variable is increasing. It also means that the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is decreasing. However, a high positive correlation does not guarantee there is a cause and effect relationship. (A negative amount indicates an inverse association…the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is increasing and vice versa.) A coefficient of correlation of +0.8 or -0.8 indicates a strong correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable. An r of +0.20 or -0.20 indicates a weak correlation between the variables. When the coefficient of correlation is 0.00 there is no correlation.",
    "Relationship of Coefficient of Correlation to Coefficient of Determination": "When the coefficient of correlation is squared, it becomes the coefficient of determination. This means that a coefficient of correlation of +0.80 will result in a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64%. (The coefficient of determination of 0.64 tells you that 64% of the change in the total of the dependent variable is associated with the change in the independent variable.) An r of +0.20 or -0.20 will result in an r-squared of only 4% (0.20 x 0.20), which means that only 4% of the change in the dependent variable is explained by the change in the independent variable.",
    "Examples of Methods for Separating Mixed Costs": "Three methods for separating mixed costs into the fixed portion and the variable portion are:",
    "Definition of Fixed Cost per Unit": "Fixed costs such as rent, salaries, depreciation, etc. generally do not change in total within a reasonable range of volume or activity. On the other hand, the fixed cost per unit will change as volume or the level of activity changes.",
    "Example of Fixed Costs per Unit": "Assume that a company has two fixed costs: rent is $2,500 per month and salaries are $3,500 per month. The total fixed costs of $6,000 per month will not change when the volume is within the range of 3,000 units to 4,000 units per month. However, the fixed cost per unit will change with any change in volume. For example, if the volume is 3,000 units, the fixed cost per unit will be $2.00 ($6,000 of fixed costs divided by 3,000 units). If the volume is 4,000 units, the fixed cost per unit will be $1.50 ($6,000 of fixed costs divided by 4,000 units).",
    "Definition of Variable Cost": "A variable cost is a constant amount per unit produced or used. Therefore, the total amount of the variable cost will change proportionately with the change in volume or activity. ",
    "Examples of Variable Costs": "Generally, a product’s direct materials are a variable cost. For example, if a bakery uses one pound of flour for every loaf of bread it produces, the flour is a variable cost. If the flour costs $0.40 per pound and no bread is produced, the total cost of flour will be $0. If one loaf is produced, the total cost of flour will be $0.40. When 10 loaves are produced, the total cost of flour will be $4. If 50 loaves are produced, the cost of flour will be $20 (50 loaves X 1 pound X $0.40 per pound). An expense can also be a variable cost. For instance, if a company pays a 5% sales commission on every sale, the company’s sales commission expense will be a variable cost. If the company has no sales, the total sales commission expense will be $0. When sales are $100,000 the sales commission expense will be $5,000. Sales of $200,000 will mean total sales commission expense of $10,000. Sales of $400,000 will result in total sales commission expense of $20,000. A retailer’s cost of goods sold is also a variable cost. Assume that a retailer’s cost of products is approximately 60% of their selling prices. If the retailer has sales of $100,000, the cost of goods sold will be approximately $60,000. When sales are $300,000, the cost of goods sold will be approximately $180,000.  ",
    "Definition of Break-Even Point": "The break-even point is the amount of sales required to cover a company’s costs and expenses that are reported on its income statement. In other words, the break-even point will result in a net income of $0 on an income statement prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The break-even point expressed in dollars of revenues is calculated by dividing the company’s total fixed expenses for the accounting period by its contribution margin ratio. The break-even point in units of products is calculated by dividing the company’s total fixed expenses for the accounting period by the contribution margin per unit. The break-even calculation assumes that the selling prices, contribution margins, and fixed expenses will not change.",
    "Examples Causing a Break-even Point to Increase": "The break-even point will increase by any of the following:",
    "Definition of Fixed Cost": "A fixed cost is one that does not change in total within a reasonable range of activity. Since the fixed cost remains constant in total, the fixed cost per unit of activity decreases when the volume increases, and the fixed cost per unit of activity increases when the volume decreases. ",
    "Examples of Fixed Costs": "Assume the rent for a production facility is a fixed cost of $120,000 per year and there are normally 30,000 machine hours of good output during a year. At that volume of activity, the rent is $4 ($120,000/30,000) per machine hour. If there are 40,000 machine hours during a year, the rent will be $3 ($120,000/40,000) per machine hour. (Of course, if there is a need to double the number of machine hours, the total amount of rent will likely increase to accommodate this large increase in activity. This is why accountants say a cost is fixed only within a reasonable or relevant range of activity.) Many manufacturing overhead costs are fixed and the amounts occur in large increments. Additional examples include depreciation on a company-owned factory, depreciation on machinery and equipment, salaries and benefits of manufacturing supervisors, factory administration costs, etc. One of the challenges regarding fixed manufacturing overhead costs is the allocation or assigning of the fixed costs to the individual units of product (which likely vary in size and complexity). The allocation is referred to as absorption costing, which is required by U.S. accounting and income tax rules for valuing a manufacturer’s inventories and its cost of goods sold. It is important to remember that while the fixed overhead is assigned to products on the basis of machine hour usage, this is not how the fixed costs behave or occur. For instance, the cost of the production facilities’ rent might be assigned to the products at the rate of $4 per machine hour, but the rent actually occurs at the rate of $10,000 per month regardless of the number of machine hours.",
    "Definition of Negative Contribution Margin": "A negative contribution margin ratio indicates that a company’s variable costs and expenses exceed its sales. In other words, if the company increases its sales with the same sales mix, it will experience larger losses.",
    "Example of Eliminating a Negative Contribution Margin": "By definition, the ways to eliminate the negative contribution margin include:",
    "Definition of Variable Expense": "An expense is  variable when its total amount changes in proportion to the change in sales, production, or some other activity. In other words, a variable expense increases when an activity increases, and it decreases when the activity decreases.  ",
    "Examples of Variable Expenses": "Assume that a website business sells a product and requires the customer to pay with a credit card. The credit card processor charges the business a fee of 3% of each amount charged. Therefore, if the business has sales of $10,000 in the month of June, the business will have a credit card expense of $300. If July’s sales are $30,000 the credit card expense will be $900. The total credit card expense varies with sales because the fee has a constant rate of 3% of sales. Another example of a variable expense is a retailer’s cost of goods sold. For instance, if a company purchases a product for $30 and is able to sell it for $50, the company’s cost of goods sold will be a constant rate of 60% ($30 / $50). Therefore, when the company has sales of $10,000 the cost of goods will be $6,000. When the sales are $30,000 the cost of goods sold will be $18,000. Knowing how costs behave when sales or other activities change will allow you to better understand how a company’s gross profit and net income will change. It also allows you to quickly calculate a product’s contribution margin and to estimate the company’s break-even point.",
    "Definition of Learning Curve": "A common learning curve shows that the cumulative average time to complete a manual task (in which learning is involved) will decrease 20% whenever the cumulative volume doubles. This common learning curve (where the cumulative average time decreases by 20%) is known as an 80% learning curve.",
    "Example of 80% Learning Curve": "To illustrate the 80% learning curve, let’s use as an example a person learning to design and code websites of similar size and complexity. If the first website takes the person 100 hours, then after the second website the cumulative average time will be 80 hours (80% of 100 hours). This cumulative average of 80 hours consists of 100 hours for the first website plus only 60 hours for the second website resulting in a total of 160 hours divided by 2 websites = 80 hours. After the fourth website the cumulative average time for all four websites will be 64 hours (80% of 80 hours). After the eighth website the cumulative average for all 8 websites will be 51.2 hours (80% of 64 hours). In other words, the total time to have completed all eight websites will be 409.6 hours (8 websites times an average time of 51.2 hours). Improvements in technology can also result in time and cost reductions beyond those in the learning curve. For example, software may become available to assist in the design and coding, computer processing speeds might increase, there may be lower costs of processing and storage, etc. In accounting, the learning curve is important for setting standards, estimating costs, and establishing selling prices.",
    "What is Simple Linear Regression Analysis": "Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool for quantifying the relationship between one independent variable (hence “simple”) and one dependent variable based on past experience (observations). Based on entering a reasonable number of observations of the independent and dependent variables, regression  software will compute the best fitting straight line (hence “linear”) that expresses the average relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Simple linear regression analysis is helpful in determining the two components of a mixed cost (also known as semivariable cost):",
    "Example of Simple Linear Regression Analysis": "Assume that a manufacturer wants to know the amount of its monthly electricity bill that is a fixed amount and how much the electricity bill changes when the number of production machine hours change. The manufacturer will look at the amount of each month’s electricity bill (the dependent variable) and then determine the number of production machine hours (the independent variable) that occurred between the meter reading dates indicated on the bill. The amount of each bill and the related production machine hours for the bill are entered into the regression software. The software determines the best fitting line based on the amounts entered. The line is expressed as y = a + bx, where:",
    "Definition of Semivariable Costs": "Semivariable costs are costs or expenses whose behavior is partially fixed and partially variable. That is, part of the total cost does not increase or decrease as an activity changes within a reasonable range of activity, while another part of the total cost increases as an activity increases and it decreases as the activity decreases. Semivariable costs are also referred to as mixed costs. The equation for a semivariable cost is Total Cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost rate X Activity.",
    "Examples of Semivariable Costs": "A common example of a semivariable cost is the annual cost of operating a vehicle. Some of the vehicle’s total annual operating costs will be the same regardless of the miles driven. These fixed costs include depreciation, insurance, and licensing. On the other hand, the vehicle’s total fuel costs will vary with the miles driven. A manufacturer’s electricity cost is another example of a semivariable cost. Each month’s electricity bill will consist of the following amounts:",
    "Definition of Differential Cost and Incremental Cost": "I use the terms differential cost and incremental cost to mean the same thing: the difference in cost between two alternatives. (I use the term marginal cost when referring to the cost of producing the very next unit or operating for just one more hour, etc.)",
    "Example of Differential Cost and Incremental Cost": "Assume a company determined that the annual cost of operating its equipment at 80,000 machine hours was $4,000,000 while the annual cost of operating its equipment at 70,000 machine hours was $3,800,000. The differential cost and/or the incremental cost of operating its equipment for the additional 10,000 machine hours was $200,000.",
    "Break-even Point in Units of Product": "The formula for determining the break-even point in units of product sold is: total fixed expenses divided by the contribution margin per unit. For example, if a company’s total fixed expenses for a year are $300,000 and it has a contribution margin of $4 per unit (selling price of $10 per unit minus variable expenses of $6 per unit), the company’s break-even point in sales for the year is 75,000 units.",
    "Break-even Point in Billable Service Hours": "For a service business, the units could be the company’s hours billed to clients. For example, if the business has total fixed expenses of $300,000 for a year and it has a contribution margin of $40 per billable hour (hourly billing rate of $100 minus variable expenses of $60 per hour), the break-even point for the year is 7,500 hours billed at $100 per hour.",
    "Break-even Point in Dollars of Revenue": "The formula for determining the break-even point in dollars of product or services is the total fixed expenses divided by the contribution margin ratio (or %). For instance, if a company has total fixed expenses for a year of $300,000 and a contribution margin ratio of 40%, the break-even point for the year in revenue dollars is $750,000.",
    "Limitation of Break-even Formula": "The break-even formula is overly simplistic for computing a company’s break-even point if the company has a wide variety of products (and/or services) with varying contribution margins and contribution margin ratios.",
    "Definition of After-Tax Cost of Debt": "The after-tax cost of debt is the interest paid on the debt minus the income tax savings as the result of deducting the interest expense on the company’s income tax return.",
    "Example of After-Tax Cost of Debt": "Let’s assume that a regular U.S. corporation has:",
    "Definition of Cost Center": "A cost center is a subunit of a company that is responsible only for its costs. A few examples of cost centers are:",
    "Definition of a Profit Center": "A profit center is a subunit of a company that is responsible for revenues and costs. If a division of a company has responsibility for revenues, costs, and the resulting profits, it is a profit center.",
    "Definition of Variance Analysis": "In accounting, a variance is the difference between an actual amount and a budgeted, planned or past amount. Variance analysis is one step in the process of identifying and explaining the reasons for different outcomes. Variance analysis is usually associated with a manufacturer’s product costs. In this setting, variance analysis attempts to identify the causes of the differences between a manufacturer’s 1) standard or planned costs of the inputs that should have occurred for the actual products manufactured, and 2) the actual costs of the inputs used for the actual products manufactured.",
    "Example of Variance Analysis": "Assume that a company manufactured 10,000 units of product (output). The company’s standards indicate that it should have used $40,000 of materials (an input), but it actually used $48,000 of materials. The variance analysis may include the following:",
    "Definition of Incremental Cost": "An incremental cost is the difference in total costs as the result of a change in some activity. Incremental costs are also referred to as the differential costs and they may be the relevant costs for certain short run decisions involving two alternatives. Note: Incremental costs may include more than the change in variable costs.",
    "Example of Incremental Cost": "Let’s assume that a company has the following experience:",
    "Definition of Static Budget": "A static budget is a budget in which the amounts will not change even with significant changes in volume. In contrast to a static budget, a company’s sales department might have a flexible budget. In the flexible budget, the sales commissions expense budget would be stated as a percentage of sales.",
    "Example of a Static Budget": "Assume that a company’s annual budget is a static budget. In this static budget is a line “sales commissions expense budget $200,000.” This means that the budget for sales commissions expense will be $200,000 whether the actual sales for the year are $2 million, $4 million or $8 million.  [In contrast, a  flexible budget  for sales commissions expense might be expressed as 5% of sales. This means that the budget for sales commissions expense will flex with sales volume. When sales are actually $2 million, the flexible budget for sales commissions will be $100,000. When sales are actually $4 million, the flexible budget for sales commissions will be $200,000. When sales are actually $8 million, the flexible budget for sales commissions will be $400,000.]",
    "Definition of Relevant Costs": "Relevant costs are future costs that will differ between two or more alternative actions. Expressed another way, relevant costs are the costs that will make a difference when making a decision. Past costs may help you predict and estimate the future costs, but the past costs are otherwise irrelevant to the decision. That is why accountants will refer to a past cost as a sunk cost.",
    "Examples of Relevant Costs": "Assume that a company has five product lines: A, B, C, D, and E. Since E accounts for only 5% of the company’s sales, the company is deciding whether to eliminate E. If E is eliminated, the compensation of E’s employees and other expenses directly associated with E (amounting to $400,000) will be eliminated. However, the company’s other expenses (executives’ compensation, depreciation, general administration) will not be reduced. The $400,000 of costs that are directly associated with E are relevant costs, since the company will see its total costs decrease by $400,000 when E is eliminated. Since the company’s other expenses will not change, the company’s other expenses are not relevant. In other words, it doesn’t matter for the decision to eliminate product line E whether the company’s other expenses are $500,000 or $5,000,000.",
    "Definition of Opportunity Costs": "Opportunity costs are the profits a company (or person) missed, or the contribution margin that was missed. Opportunity cost might be thought of as the opportunity lost or the opportunity missed. The missed contribution margin is the net of the revenues that were missed minus the variable costs that were avoided.",
    "Calculating Opportunity Costs": "Since opportunity costs are the missed revenues associated with a missed opportunity you won’t  find them in the company’s general ledger. You will have to estimate them. The same holds true for the variable costs and expenses associated with the missed revenues and the missed opportunity.   ",
    "Example of Calculating Opportunity Costs": "Assume that a small manufacturer has a limited number of machine hours available on its large specialized machine. The setup time to prepare the machine to run a different job is 4 hours. During these 4 hours, the company is losing the opportunity to generate profits had the machine been running. Next, assume that the machine is billed out to customers at $200 per hour and the variable costs of operating the machine are estimated to be $60 per hour. This means that when the machine is not running, the company is missing the opportunity to earn a contribution of $140 per machine hour. During the 4-hour setup time, the company is missing/losing/foregoing a contribution of $560 (4 hours X $140). In other words, the company’s opportunity cost for setting up the machine is $560. A bean counter might look in the company’s payroll records and say that the cost of setting up the machine is 4 hours X $40 (the hourly wage and benefits of the setup person) = $160. An astute business person would say that the real cost of having this machine idle for 4 hours X $140 (the lost hourly contribution margin) = $560. Even though opportunity cost of $560 per setup is not found in the general ledger accounts, it should be used when quoting or setting prices for using the machine. In other words, the pricing of the machine’s output should begin with $560 for setting up the machine. If the company finds its prices to be higher than its competition, it should find ways to reduce the number of hours necessary to set up the machine and/or find other areas for reducing costs.",
    "Definition of a Favorable Budget Variance": "A favorable budget variance means that the actual amount that occurred was better for the company (or organization) than the amount that had been budgeted. This means a favorable budget variance will occur when:",
    "Examples of Favorable Budget Variances": "Here are three examples of favorable budget variances reported by a manufacturer for a recent month:",
    "Definition of Decentralization": "Decentralization refers to a company’s top management delegating authority to subunits or segments of the company such as a company consisting of a consumer products division and an industrial division, or a corporation organized into several subsidiary companies.  A benefit of decentralization is having the decision makers closer to the markets to make better and faster decisions. Another benefit of decentralization is having more individuals share the work involved in decision making. This in turn provides excellent training and development for the future leaders of the company. A disadvantage of decentralization occurs if a subunit makes a decision that is good for the subunit’s financial results, but it results in less than optimal profits for the company as a whole.",
    "Examples of Decentralization": "A corporation may have several operating businesses each of which is responsible for its revenues and expenses. However, investment decisions for the operating businesses remain centralized. That is, the corporation’s executive officers decide which investments will be made in the operating businesses. In this situation, the businesses are referred to as profit centers.  If the operating businesses make their own investment decisions, the businesses are referred to as investment centers. The production and administrative departments within a company are generally cost centers. Generally, cost centers are responsible only for the costs that the department head can control.",
    "Definition of Transfer Pricing": "Transfer pricing involves setting a price that will be used when one responsibility center of a company sells goods or services to another responsibility center of the same company. The responsibility centers are often profit centers of a decentralized corporation such as related subsidiary corporations, separate divisions of a corporation, or some other subunits.  Depending on the production capacity and the demand for each subunit’s goods or services, a transfer price could be based on cost, market prices, variable costs plus an opportunity cost, or some other amount. A concern with transfer pricing is whether the transfer price will cause a subunit’s manager to take the action that is best for the company as a whole.",
    "Example of Transfer Pricing": "Assume that Giant Corporation has several subsidiary companies including Sub1 and Sub2. Sub1 manufactures electronic components that it sells to companies throughout the world. Sub2 manufactures a unique consumer gadget that uses a component that Sub1 manufactures. Sub1 sells the component for $20 to its many outside customers and its cost to manufacture the unit is $12. The transfer price is the amount that Sub2 will pay Sub 1 for each component it needs. If Sub 1 has idle capacity, it can make an additional profit even with a transfer price of less than $20. However, Sub2 will be able to sell far more of its profitable consumer gadgets if its cost of the component from Sub 1 is $16. It may be in the best interest of Giant Corporation to arrange for both Sub1 and Sub2 to agree to a transfer price of $16.",
    "Definition of Death Spiral": "In cost accounting and managerial accounting, the term death spiral refers to the repeated elimination of a manufacturer’s products which will result in spreading the fixed manufacturing overhead costs to fewer products. In addition, the low volume cannot support its administrative expenses. The death spiral is also known as the downward demand spiral.",
    "Example of Death Spiral": "Assume that a company manufactures a wide variety of products that require multiple, complicated processes involving expensive equipment. It also manufacturers Products X & Y, which are much higher volume products using a simple process involving inexpensive machines. If the company allocates its fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products based on volume (such as production machine hours), Products X & Y will  appear to have high overhead costs. (In reality, Products X & Y cause very little overhead cost in relation to the main, complicated, lower volume products.) If management responds to the high allocated overhead costs for Products X & Y by seeking price increases from its customers, the customers may move the production to a competitor who realizes there is little overhead costs involved in the products. With the Products X & Y no longer being manufactured, the company’s manufacturing production machine hours will decrease significantly. If the company does not reduce its fixed manufacturing overhead and the accountant continues to spread the overhead costs—including the cost of excess capacity—on the basis of volume, the remaining products will have to be assigned more of the overhead costs. If management again reacts to the new, higher, allocated costs by seeking price increases and loses sales, the company’s manufacturing volume will decrease further. If fixed costs are not decreased accordingly and the accountant again spreads the overhead on the basis of fewer production machine hours, the entire company could die from the high fixed costs and a small volume of products that cannot support the manufacturing and administrative costs. To avoid the death spiral, some companies attempt to allocate overhead costs based on activities and product complexities rather than simply spreading them on production machine hours. Also, some companies do not allocate the costs of excess capacity to products in order to minimize the death spiral.",
    "Definition of Zero-Based Budgeting": "Zero-based budgeting, or ZBB, is a rigorous budgeting process that requires that every dollar of every expense in the budget be justified, even if the expense has been occurring at the same level for years. In other words, instead of the common budgeting practice of accepting the past level of an expense and adjusting that amount for the new budget, ZBB starts with $0 and requires that every dollar must be justified to be included in the new budget.",
    "Example of Zero-Based Budgeting": "Assume that a company has been spending $100,000 a year for the rent of a warehouse. In the past budgets the company accepted the $100,000 of rent and focused on the amount of the increase for the next budget. This year the chief executive of the company insists that the company begin using zero-based budgeting. This means that the starting amount for warehouse rent (and every other expense) for the next budget is $0. Any budgeted expense greater than $0 must be justified. While zero-based budgeting will be more time consuming than focusing on incremental changes, ZBB can result in significant cost savings. For instance, the analysis and documentation of the warehousing activities required by zero-based budgeting may lead to a better use of space, better inventory management, etc. If those efficiencies are achievable, perhaps the budget for the warehouse rent should be $60,000 (instead of $103,000 or more). Zero-based budgeting was widely discussed in the 1970s for businesses and governments. Today, it is again being discussed since a few large corporations have used the ZBB process to significantly reduce unnecessary expenses.",
    "Definition of Correlation": "Correlation refers to the association between two or more variables. The association is measured by a statistic known as the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient), which has a range of -1 to +1 (“0” indicates no correlation and “1” indicates perfect correlation). Measuring the correlation between variables can be helpful, but a high degree of correlation does not guarantee that a change in one variable was actually caused by the other variable. (Often early medical research indicates the discovery of association between X and Y, but additional studies must be done before they can conclude there is cause and effect.) To recap, correlation does not assure that there is a cause and effect relationship. However, if there is a cause and effect relationship, there has to be correlation. ",
    "Example of Correlation": "Assume that during a 10-year period the number of cars sold in the U.S. moved in the same direction as the country’s rate of inflation. Even with a 10-year correlation between the two sets of data, it is unlikely that more inflation caused an increase in the number of cars sold.  Accountants can find the level of correlation between variables by using statistical software. For example,  simple linear regression analysis (and multiple regression analysis) software can be used to determine the relationship of production machine hours and mixed costs.",
    "Definition of Sunk Cost": "A sunk cost is a cost that was incurred in the past and cannot be undone. Since most transactions cannot be undone, most amounts spent in the past are sunk. A past or sunk cost will be there regardless of what is decided today or in the future. Expressed another way, since we cannot undo the past, every decision will affect only today and/or the future. As a result, the relevant costs and benefits for making a decision are the current and future costs. Unfortunately, we do not find the future costs in a company’s general ledger. At best, those past/sunk costs may help us determine the relevant current and future costs and potential income tax benefits.",
    "Example of a Sunk Cost": "Assume that a year ago a company spent $100,000 to purchase and install a new machine. Today, a robot became available for $80,000 and it is expected to reduce expenses by $50,000 in each of the next 10 years. Today, the one-year-old machine can be sold for just $10,000. In the decision whether to purchase the robot, the $100,000 spent on the one-year-old machine is a sunk cost.  Ignoring any income tax consequences, what is relevant for the decision on purchasing the robot is whether to spend an additional $70,000 today (the $80,000 cost of the robot minus the $10,000 to be received from the old machine) in order to save $50,000 each year for 10 years. It may be difficult to accept that $100,000 was spent a year ago, but spending an additional $70,000 today to earn (reduce expenses) $50,000 each year for 10 year is really a simple decision.",
    "Definition of Capital Budgeting": "Capital budgeting is a process used by companies for evaluating and ranking potential capital expenditures or investments that are significant in amount. A few examples of capital expenditures include:",
    "Examples of Capital Budgeting Calculations": "Capital budgeting usually involves the following calculations for each project:",
    "Definition of Evaluating Capital Expenditures": "Capital expenditures involve large amounts of money spent on assets that have a useful life of more than one year.  Capital expenditures may vary in necessity and profitability:",
    "Examples of Methods for Evaluating Capital Expenditures": "Of course, capital expenditures that are necessary to continue operating are identified first. These could be government mandates as well as other necessities such as a new sewer line, upgrading the electrical service, etc. When deciding which of the non-necessary projects should be undertaken, companies likely use various techniques for ranking the projects from a financial point of view. The following are four common techniques:",
    "Definition of Manufacturing Overhead": "Manufacturing overhead (also known as factory overhead, factory burden, production overhead) involves a company’s manufacturing operations. It includes the costs incurred in the manufacturing facilities other than the costs of direct materials and direct labor. Hence, manufacturing overhead is referred to as an indirect cost. Generally accepted accounting principles require that a manufacturer’s inventory and the cost of goods sold shall consist of:",
    "Examples of Manufacturing Overhead": "Some examples of manufacturing overhead costs include the following:",
    "Definition of a Flexible Budget": "A flexible budget is a budget that adjusts or flexes with changes in volume or activity. The flexible budget is more sophisticated and useful than a static budget. (The static budget amounts do not change. They remain unchanged from the amounts established at the time that the static budget was prepared and approved.) For costs that vary with volume or activity, the flexible budget will flex because the budget will include a variable rate per unit of activity instead of one fixed total amount. In short, the flexible budget is a more useful tool when measuring a manager’s efficiency.",
    "Example of a Flexible Budget": "Let’s assume a company determines that its cost of electricity and supplies will vary by approximately $10 for each machine hour (MH) used. It also knows that other costs are fixed costs of  approximately $40,000 per month. Typically, the machine hours are between 4,000 and 7,000 hours per month. Based on this information, the flexible budget for each month would be $40,000 + $10 per MH. Now let’s illustrate the flexible budget by using different levels of volume. If 5,000 machine hours were necessary for the month of January, the flexible budget for January will be $90,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 5,000 MH). If the machine hours in February are 6,300 hours, then the flexible budget for February will be $103,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 6,300 MH). If March has 4,100 machine hours, the flexible budget for March will be $81,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 4,100 MH).",
    "Definition of Process Costing": "Process costing is a term used in cost accounting to describe one method for collecting and assigning manufacturing costs to the units produced. A processing cost system is used when nearly identical units are mass produced. (Job costing or job order costing is a system used to collect and assign manufacturing costs to units that vary from one another.) ",
    "Example of Process Costing": "Let’s assume that a company manufactures large quantities of an identical product. The product requires several processing operations, each of which occurs in a separate department. In the first department, the following processing costs were incurred during the month of June:",
    "Job Order Costing vs Process Costing": "Job Order Costing\nJob order costing or job costing is a cost accounting system typically used to accumulate the manufacturing costs of expensive products such as a special machine, yacht, building, system, or for a batch of products.  Generally, job costing is used when each job (or batch) is sufficiently different from other jobs and the costs are significant. (If identical products are mass produced in large continuous quantities, the process costing system is more appropriate.)  Process Costing\nProcess costing is a cost accounting system for calculating the manufacturing costs (direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead) of similar or identical products that are mass produced through a continuous process or series of processes.  When there is a series of processes, each process is likely to occur in a separate production department or cost center. Common examples of production departments include: ",
    "Examples of Cost Centers": "A manufacturer’s cost centers will often include:",
    "Definition of Actual Overhead": "In the context of actual and applied overhead, actual overhead refers to a manufacturer’s indirect manufacturing costs. (Costs that are outside of the manufacturing operations, such as marketing and general management, are expenses of the accounting period and are not applied or assigned to products.) Actual overhead are the manufacturing costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Since the overhead costs are not directly traceable to products, the overhead costs must be allocated, assigned, or applied to goods produced.",
    "Examples of Actual Overhead": "A few of the many overhead costs are:",
    "Definition of Applied Overhead": "Applied overhead is the amount of the manufacturing overhead that is assigned to the goods produced. This is usually done by using a predetermined annual overhead rate.",
    "Example of Applied Overhead": "Let’s assume that a company expects to have $800,000 of overhead costs in the upcoming year. It also expects that it will have its normal 16,000 of production machine hours during the upcoming year. As a result, the company will apply, allocate, or assign overhead to the goods manufactured using a predetermined overhead rate of $50 ($800,000 divided by 16,000) for every production machine hour used. Since the future overhead costs and future number of machine hours were not known with certainty, and since the actual machine hours will not occur uniformly throughout the year, there will always be a difference between the actual overhead costs incurred and the amount of overhead applied to the manufactured goods. Hopefully, the differences will be not be significant at the end of the accounting year.",
    "Definition of Cost Allocation": "Cost allocation is the assigning of a cost to several cost objects such as products or departments. The cost allocation is needed because the cost is not directly traceable to a specific object. Since the cost is not directly traceable, the resulting allocation is somewhat arbitrary. Because of the arbitrariness, some people describe cost allocation as the spreading of a cost. Accountants have made efforts to improve the cost allocation techniques. Over time, manufacturers’ overhead allocations have moved from a plant-wide rates to departmental rates. Some allocations that were allocated on the basis of direct labor hours are now based on machine hours. In order to improve those bases of allocations, some accountants are implementing activity based costing. The goal is to reduce the arbitrariness by identifying the various root causes of the overhead costs.",
    "Examples of Cost Allocations": "The following are only a few of the many cost allocations that occur in some companies or organizations:",
    "Definition of Direct Costs": "Direct costs are directly traceable to a cost object such as a product or a department. In other words, direct costs do not have to be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object. (A cost that must be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object is an indirect cost.)",
    "Examples of Direct Costs": "Assume that a company produces artisan furniture. The following are direct product costs and they are direct production department costs:",
    "Definition of Responsibility Center": "A responsibility center is a part or subunit of a company in which the manager has some degree of authority and responsibility. The company’s detailed organization chart is a logical source for identifying responsibility centers. The most common responsibility centers are the numerous departments within a company.",
    "Examples of Responsibility Centers": "Responsibility centers are often categorized by the degree of authority and responsibility given to the manager:",
    "Cost Categories of a Manufactured Product": "Prime costs and conversion costs pertain to the three cost categories of a manufactured product:",
    "Definition of Prime Costs": "Prime costs are the combination of the two direct product costs:",
    "Definition of Traditional Method in Cost Accounting": "The traditional method of cost accounting refers to the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs to the products manufactured. The traditional method is also referred to as the conventional method. Typically the traditional method meant allocating the manufacturing overhead costs on the basis of the number of units of output, the direct labor hours, or the production machine hours.  Allocating the many different (and ever increasing amounts of) indirect manufacturing costs on the basis of a single factor (such as machine hours) is likely to lead to misleading costs for a manufacturer’s goods. To address this deficiency, the activity based costing (ABC) method attempts to identify all of the diverse activities that occur and assign the costs of those activities only to the products that require the activities.",
    "Example of Traditional Method of Cost Accounting": "Assume that a manufacturer has $2,000,000 of manufacturing overhead costs consisting of depreciation, electricity, insurance, compensation of supervisors, production engineers, material handlers, equipment maintenance, etc. The manufacturer has 40,000 production machine hours. Using the traditional method of cost accounting, the company will allocate or assign $50 of overhead of each machine used to produce the output. Applying $50 per machine hour for every product will spread the overhead costs, but will not recognize the variety of activities and efforts that occur with different products.  The traditional method may have been reasonable or at least sufficient for the company’s external financial statements (especially when similar products are manufactured and inventory levels are consistently small). However, the traditional method will be inadequate for determining the true cost for diverse goods being produced and sold to customers with diverse demands.",
    "Definition of Indirect Manufacturing Costs": "Indirect manufacturing costs are a manufacturer’s production costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, factory burden, or burden. US GAAP requires that indirect manufacturing costs be allocated to, assigned to, or absorbed by the manufacturer’s output (in addition to the cost of direct materials and direct labor) for its  external financial statements. This is known as absorption costing and must be used in determining a manufacturer’s cost of goods sold and the cost of its inventory. In traditional cost accounting, the indirect manufacturing costs are allocated to the products manufactured based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or production machine hours. However, in recent decades the indirect manufacturing costs have increased significantly and are less likely to be caused by the quantity of direct labor or production machine hours. (This may not be a problem for financial reporting when the amount of inventory is consistently small, but it can be a problem for pricing and other decisions.)",
    "Examples of Indirect Manufacturing Costs": "Some examples of indirect manufacturing costs include:",
    "Definition of Relevant Range": "In accounting, the term relevant range usually refers to a normal range of volume or normal amount of activity in which the total amount of a company’s fixed costs will not change as the volume or amount of activity changes. The term relevant range is included in the definition of fixed costs, because if a company’s volume were to decline to an extremely low level, the company would take action to decrease its total amount of fixed costs. Similarly, if the company’s volume were to increase dramatically, the company would likely have to increase the total amount of its fixed costs.  ",
    "Example of Relevant Range": "Let’s assume that a manufacturer’s monthly production volume is consistently between 10,000 to 13,000 units of product requiring between 20,000 to 25,000 machine hours. Within these ranges of activity, the manufacturing operations run smoothly with the same amount of monthly fixed costs, which on average are approximately $200,000 per month for the cost of supervisors, rent, depreciation, and other fixed costs. However, if the manufacturer’s volume were to drop to say 7,000 units of product and/or to 14,000 machine hours, it would likely reduce the number of its supervisors, the space it rents, and some other fixed costs in order to reduce the $200,000 of monthly fixed costs. If the company’s volume were to increase to 18,000 units of product and/or 30,000 machine hours, the company would likely have to increase its total fixed costs to pay for additional supervisors, space, and other fixed costs. Hence, an experienced accountant would say that the company’s fixed costs are approximately $200,000 per month within a relevant range of activity.",
    "Definition of Plant-wide Overhead Rate": "A plant-wide overhead rate is often a single rate per hour or a percentage of some cost that is used to allocate or assign a company’s manufacturing overhead costs to the goods produced. A plant-wide rate could be adequate in the following situations:",
    "Example of Plant-wide Overhead Rate": "Let’s assume that a company’s manufacturing overhead costs (equipment depreciation, electricity, maintenance, supervisors, etc.) is budgeted to be $800,000 for the new year. The company produces similar products and it expects to use 20,000 machine hours. Based on this information, the company’s plant-wide overhead rate will be $40 per machine hour. If each product requires 15 minutes of machine time, each product’s cost will include $10 of manufacturing overhead (15 minutes = 1/4 hour X $40 per machine hour).",
    "Definition of a Budget": "In business and other organizations, a budget often refers to a department’s or a company’s projected revenues, costs, or expenses.",
    "Definition of a Standard": "In accounting, a standard is likely to mean an expected amount per unit of product, per unit of input (such as direct materials, factory overhead), or per unit of output.",
    "Examples of a Budget and a Standard": "Typically, a manufacturer will have a budget for each of its manufacturing departments. Assume that the finishing department’s budget for the upcoming year is $400,000 and is expected to process 50,000 identical units of product.  Some companies will develop standard costs for controlling its operations. For example, the standard cost of processing all identical units in the finishing department is $8 (based on its budget of $400,000 divided by the expected 50,000 identical units). Therefore, if 4,000 units are processed, the standard cost of the company’s inventory will be increased by $32,000. If the products processed by the finishing department are not identical (some require 0.6 a machine hour, some 1.0 machine hour, some 1.2 machine hours) the finishing department’s $400,000 budget could be divided by the total expected number of machine hours. Assume that total number of expected machine hours is 40,000 to finish the 50,000 units of product. Therefore, the standard cost for each expected machine hour will be $10 ($400,000 budget divided by the expected 40,000 machine hours). If the finishing of 4,000 units should have taken 3,500 standard machine hours, the standard cost of the units processed in the finishing department will be $35,000 (3,500 standard machine hours X $10 standard cost per machine hour).",
    "Definition of Setup Cost": "In manufacturing, setup cost is the cost incurred to get equipment ready to process a different batch of goods. Hence, setup cost is regarded as a batch-level cost in activity based costing. Setup cost is considered to be a non-value-added cost that should be minimized.",
    "Examples of Setup Costs": "Setup costs include the following:",
    "Definition of Actual Costing": "For a manufacturer, actual costing means assigning the following costs to the actual goods produced each month:",
    "Examples of Normal Costing and Actual Costing": "Assume that a manufacturer experiences an additional $200,000 in manufacturing overhead costs (air conditioning and other) in each of the months of June, July, and August. The overhead costs in each of the other 9 months is $1,000,000. Therefore, on an annual basis the manufacturing overhead is $12,600,000. Assume that the overhead costs are assigned/allocated/applied to products using machine hours (MHs). MHs are 50,000 each month, except for December and January when each month has 30,000 MHs. Therefore, for the year there are expected to be 560,000 MHs. Using normal costing, the company applies the manufacturing overhead to products at a rate of $22.50 per MH ($12,600,000/560,000 MH) throughout the year. Using actual costing, the company will apply the manufacturing overhead to products at the following rates:",
    "Definition of Fixed Overhead Absorbed": "Fixed overhead absorbed refers to a manufacturer’s fixed indirect manufacturing/production costs. Since these costs are indirect, they must be assigned or allocated to the products manufactured. This is required because U.S. accounting principles and income tax regulations require manufacturers to follow full absorption costing. This means that the cost of manufactured goods must include the costs of the direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and fixed manufacturing overhead. Accountants will state that the goods produced must absorb the fixed manufacturing overhead costs. It is common that the fixed manufacturing overhead costs are absorbed by the goods produced (or are assigned/allocated to the goods produced) through predetermined overhead rates based on the number of machine hours.",
    "Example of Fixed Overhead Absorbed": "Assume that TOPCO has budgeted next year’s fixed manufacturing overhead costs to be $2,000,000 (consisting of depreciation on its equipment, salaries of the managers involved in the manufacturing operations, utilities, etc.). TOPCO also anticipates there will be 100,000 machine hours (MHs) involved in the production of goods. Therefore, the company will be assigning to the goods produced (and the goods will be absorbing) the fixed manufacturing overhead costs at the rate of $20 per MH.  If the actual production volume is less than the planned volume (and the costs are as planned) the fixed manufacturing overhead will be underabsorbed. When the actual volume exceeds the planned volume (and the costs are as planned) the fixed manufacturing overhead will be overabsorbed.",
    "Definition of Traditional Method Allocating Factory Overhead": "The traditional method of allocating factory overhead (manufacturing overhead, burden) means spreading the manufacturing overhead costs to the goods produced on the basis of the number of the production machine hours used or the number of direct labor hours used.",
    "Weakness of Traditional Method of Allocating Factory Overhead": "The weakness of the traditional method is that all of the factory overhead is being assigned to the goods produced by just one factor such as the production machine hours. In reality there are many factors that are driving up the factory overhead costs. Here are a few examples of some of the activities (in addition to the production machine hours) that cause the factory overhead costs to increase:",
    "Definition of Service Department": "A service department is usually associated with a manufacturer’s production departments. However, a service department does not produce any of the factory’s output. Instead, it provides services to the production departments. Each service department is responsible for its costs. Hence, the service departments are separate cost centers. The costs incurred by the service departments are considered to be indirect manufacturing costs that ultimately must get allocated to the goods produced.",
    "Examples of Service Departments": "Common examples of service departments include:",
    "Definition of Departmental Overhead Rates": "Departmental overhead rates are used by many manufacturers to allocate (assign, apply) manufacturing overhead to the goods it produces instead of using a single, plant-wide overhead rate. The reason for departmental overhead rates is that manufacturers are likely to produce many diverse products which use different processes in different departments and each has different costs.",
    "Example of Departmental Overhead Rates": "Assume that a manufacturer has three processes or operations that occur in separate departments:",
    "Definition of Overabsorbed and Underabsorbed": "In cost accounting, overabsorbed and underabsorbed pertain to a manufacturer’s manufacturing overhead costs. The manufacturing overhead costs are the indirect product and production costs. (These are in addition to the other product and production costs of direct materials and direct labor.)  Since the fixed manufacturing overhead costs (such as depreciation, salaries of manufacturing personnel, etc.) are indirect costs that occur in large amounts, they must be assigned or allocated to the products manufactured. This is often done by using a predetermined overhead rate. The predetermined rate is likely based on the amount from the annual manufacturing overhead budget divided by some activity such as the expected number of machine hours. The assigning of fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs are part of the cost accounting method known as absorption costing, which is required by U.S. GAAP and U.S. income tax regulations. Absorption costing means that fixed manufacturing costs must be assigned to the products manufactured. In other words, the products must absorb the fixed manufacturing overhead. If the amount of overhead assigned to the products manufactured is greater than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have overabsorbed the overhead costs. If the amount of overhead assigned to the products is less than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have underabsorbed the overhead costs.",
    "Example of Overabsorbed and Underabsorbed Overhead Costs": "Assume a manufacturer has an annual budget of $1,000,000 for its fixed manufacturing overhead and expects its production machines to run 40,000 hours. It’s predetermined fixed overhead rate will be $25 per machine hour. If the actual costs end up being $1,000,000 but the machines ran 41,000 hours to produce good products, the products overabsorbed the fixed overhead by $25,000 ($1,025,000 absorbed – $1,000,000 of actual costs). If the machines ran 39,400 hours to produce good units, the products underabsorbed the fixed overhead by $15,000 ($985,000 absorbed – $1,000,000 of actual costs).",
    "Definition of Indirect Cost": "An indirect cost is a cost that is not directly traceable to a cost object (product, department, etc.). Rather, the indirect cost is sometimes referred to as a common cost which is allocated to the cost objects in a logical manner.",
    "Examples of Indirect Costs": "For example, the depreciation of a company’s manufacturing building is an indirect cost of the following:",
    "Definition of Predetermined Overhead Rate": "A predetermined overhead rate is often an annual rate used to assign or allocate indirect manufacturing costs to the goods it produces. Manufacturing overhead is allocated to products for various reasons including compliance with U.S. accounting principles and income tax regulations. Traditionally, the predetermined manufacturing overhead rate was calculated prior to a new year by dividing the budgeted amount of manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year by the normal or expected number of production machine hours for the upcoming year. Using the planned annual amounts for the upcoming year reduces the  fluctuations that would occur if monthly rates were used. A manufacturer producing a variety of products that require different processes will have multiple overhead rates known as departmental overhead rates instead of just one plant-wide overhead rate.",
    "Example of Predetermined Overhead Rate": "Prior to the start of the accounting year, JKL Corp calculates the predetermined annual overhead rate to be used in the new year. JKL’s profit plan for the new year includes $1,200,000 as the budgeted amount of manufacturing overhead. JKL allocates the manufacturing overhead based on the normal and expected number of production machine hours which are 20,000 for the new year. Therefore, the JKL’s predetermined manufacturing overhead rate for the new year will be $60 ($1,200,000/20,000) per production machine hour.",
    "Definition of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports": "Negative variances are the unfavorable differences between two amounts, such as:",
    "Examples of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports": "Assume that a company had the following following information for a recent month:",
    "Definition of Cost Variance": "Generally a cost variance is the difference between the actual amount of a cost and its budgeted or planned amount. For example, if a company had actual repairs expense of $950 for May but the budgeted amount was $800, the company had a cost variance of $150. When the actual cost is more than the budgeted amount, the cost variance is said to be unfavorable. When an actual cost is less than the budgeted amount, the cost variance is said to be favorable.",
    "Cost Variances in Standard Costing Systems": "Cost variances are a key part of the standard costing system used by some manufacturers. In such a system, the cost variances direct attention to the difference between 1) the standard, predetermined and expected costs of the good output, and 2) the actual manufacturing costs incurred. These cost variances send a signal to management that the company is experiencing actual costs that are different from the company’s plan. Standard costing systems report a minimum of two cost variances for each of the following manufacturing costs:",
    "Definition of Purchase Price Variance": "In standard costing, the purchase price variance is the difference between the actual cost per pound (or other unit of measure) for the raw materials the company purchased and the company’s standard cost per pound for the raw materials that were purchased. (The standard cost per pound is the cost that the company expected to pay for the year and was included in the company’s profit plan.) Any price variances for the materials purchased are recorded in the company’s general ledger account Materials Purchase Price Variance.  The company’s general ledger accounts for inventories (raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods) and the cost of goods sold will contain the standard cost per pound for the raw materials.",
    "Example of Reclassifying the Purchase Price Variance": "Before a company’s financial statements are issued, the balance in the Materials Purchase Price Variance account must be reclassified or allocated to the following: raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold. The allocation should be based on the location of the raw materials which created the purchase price variance. If those raw materials were recently purchased and are entirely in the raw materials inventory, then all of the price variance should be assigned to the raw materials inventory. If the price variance occurred throughout the year, the variance should be assigned to the raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold based on the quantity of the raw materials in each of these categories at the end of the year. (If the amount of the purchase price variance is very small and/or the inventory turnover rates are very high, the entire amount of the price variance might be reclassified entirely to the cost of goods sold.)",
    "Definition of Flexible Budget and Flexible Budget Variance": "First, a flexible budget is a budget in which some amounts will increase or decrease when the level of activity changes. A flexible budget variance is the difference between 1) an actual amount, and 2) the amount allowed by the flexible budget.",
    "Static Budget vs. Flexible Budget": "To help in understanding the flexible budget variance, let’s assume that you are the manager of a company’s shipping department. You prepared the department’s annual budget based on the company’s assumption that 50,000 items will be shipped during the budget year. If the annual budget is not changed when more or less than 50,000 items are shipped, it is referred to as a static budget. A summary of the department’s static budget based on shipping 50,000 items is:\nFixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $150,000 (50,000 items X $3 each) = total static budget of $500,000. Unlike the static budget, a flexible budget for the shipping department will increase when more than 50,000 items for the year are shipped and it will decrease when fewer than 50,000 items are shipped. Let’s assume that for the year, the department actually shipped 54,000 items. Therefore, the flexible budget for the variable expenses will “flex” for shipping the additional 4,000 items. The resulting flexible budget summary is:\nFixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $162,000 (54,000 items X $3 each) = total flexible budget of $512,000.",
    "Flexible Budget Variance": "Now let’s assume that the shipping department’s actual expenses for the year were:\nFixed expenses of $351,000 + variable expenses of $157,000 = total actual expenses of $508,000. The department’s total flexible budget variance is $4,000 favorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were less than the flexible budget of $512,000. Note that the shipping department’s total static budget variance is $8,000 unfavorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were more than the static budget of $500,000. The $12,000 difference between the two variances result from the flexible budget being increased by $12,000 to recognize that an additional 4,000 items had to be shipped at a budgeted shipping cost of $3 per item.",
    "Flexible Budgets Could Flex for Various Activities": "The activities that could cause flexible budgets to flex might be the amount of sales, units of output, machine hours, miles traveled, etc.",
    "Definition of Production Volume Variance": "The production volume variance is associated with a standard costing system used by some manufacturers. This variance arises when there is a difference in the following amounts:",
    "Example of Production Volume Variance": "Assume that a manufacturer had budgeted $300,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead (supervisors’ compensation, depreciation, etc.) for the upcoming year. During that year, it expects to have 30,000 production machine hours of good output. Based on this, the manufacturer established a predetermined fixed manufacturing overhead rate of $10 per standard machine hour. If the company actually produces 29,000 standard machine hours of good output, the output (products) will be assigned (or will have absorbed) $290,000 of the fixed manufacturing overhead. This will cause an unfavorable production volume variance of $10,000 ($300,000 budgeted vs. $290,000 assigned; or 1,000 too few standard machine hours of good output X $10 per standard machine hour). If our example had stated that the manufacturer actually produced 32,000 standard machine hours of good output, the products would have been assigned $320,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead costs compared to the budgeted amount of $300,000. This would result in a favorable production volume variance of $20,000 ($300,000 budgeted vs. $320,000 assigned; or 2,000 additional standard machine hours of good output X $10 per standard machine hour).",
    "Definition of BOM": "BOM is the acronym for bill of materials. A BOM is a listing of the quantities of each of the materials used to manufacture a product. Industrial manufacturers are likely to have an enormous number of BOMs.  Each of the BOMs will be a very detailed list of all of the quantities of every material used in the various steps of manufacturing each product or component part.",
    "Example of BOM": "Assume that a small company manufactures gourmet pies. There will be a bill of materials (BOM) for each batch of similar pies. The BOM will list the number of pounds (or other unit of measure) of the specific fruit, the quantity and type of sugar (or other sweetener), the quantity and type of cinnamon, the quantity of nutmeg, the type of pie crust. There will also be a BOM for a batch of each type of pie crust. This BOM will list the quantity and type of flour, the quantity and type of butter (or oil), the quantity of salt, etc.",
    "Definition of Direct Materials Variances": "Direct materials variances (pertaining to standard costing) commonly consist of two variances:",
    "Definition of Direct Labor Variances": "Direct labor variances often consist of two parts:",
    "Example of Relationship Between Direct Materials Variances and Direct Labor Variances": "There can be a connection between the direct materials variances and the direct labor variances (as well as with  other variances). For example, assume a company purchases a lower costing material in order to achieve a favorable materials price variance. If these materials have some negative qualities, it may lead to an unfavorable materials usage variance. If the materials’ negative qualities cause additional direct labor hours, an unfavorable direct labor efficiency variance will result. If the materials required using more experienced labor, it is possible that a labor rate variance will also occur. The above situation can also extend to the overhead variances. If more electricity and supplies had to be used because of the lesser quality of materials, this can also mean an unfavorable variable overhead efficiency variance. If the volume of output is curtailed by the quality of the materials, there could possibly be a fixed overhead volume variance. Companies should have specifications for its materials in order to prevent the above situation from occurring.",
    "When is a Variance Unfavorable": "The term unfavorable variance indicates that the variance (or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts) was not good for the company’s profits. In other words, this unfavorable variance is one reason for the company’s actual profits being worse than the budgeted profits. ",
    "Unfavorable Expense Variance": "If repairs expense was budgeted to be $50,000 but the actual repairs expense ends up being $63,000, the $13,000 variance is unfavorable because having more actual expenses than were budgeted was not good for the company’s profits. It is one reason why the company’s actual profits were worse than the budgeted profits.",
    "Unfavorable Revenue Budget": "If a company has budgeted its revenues to be $280,000 and the actual revenues end up being $271,000, the company will have an unfavorable variance of $9,000. The variance is unfavorable because having less actual revenues than the budgeted amount was not good for the company’s profits. It will also be one reason for the company’s actual profits being worse than the budgeted profits. ",
    "Definition of Public Accounting": "Public accounting can be viewed as firms of accountants that serve clients such as businesses (retailers, manufacturers, service companies, etc.), individuals, nonprofit organizations, and governmental organizations. Public accounting firms range in size from sole practitioners to a few huge international firms that employ hundreds of thousands of CPAs throughout the world. In between are local and regional firms as well as very large national and international firms.  The people employed in public accounting are often certified public accountants or CPAs. Many accountants leave the larger public accounting firms after several years of experience and become an employee at a business or other organization. In their new position they are referred to as a private accountant, corporate accountant or internal accountant.",

If the actual sales end up being only $900,000 the budget for sales commissions will remain unchanged at the fixed amount of $50,000. If the actual sales are $1,100,000 the budget for sales commissions will also be $50,000.
