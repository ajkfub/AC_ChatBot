{"Definition of General Ledger Account": "A general ledger account is an account or record used to sort, store and summarize a company\u2019s transactions. These accounts are arranged in the general ledger (and in the chart of accounts) with the balance sheet accounts appearing first followed by the income statement accounts.", "Examples of General Ledger Accounts": "Some of the more common balance sheet accounts and how they are further arranged in the general ledger include:", "General Ledger Control Accounts": "Some general ledger accounts can become summary records and will be referred to as control accounts. In that situation all of the detail that supports the summary amounts in one of the control accounts will be available in a subsidiary ledger.", "Examples of General Ledger Control Accounts": "A common example of a general ledger account that can become a control account is Accounts Receivable. The summary amounts are found in the Accounts Receivable control account and the details for each customer\u2019s credit activity will be contained in the Accounts Receivable subsidiary ledger. Other general ledger accounts that may become control accounts include Inventory, Equipment, and Accounts Payable.", "Sales Tax Calculation": "To calculate the sales tax that is included in a company\u2019s receipts, we first calculate the amount of sales revenue that the company has earned. (Keep in mind that in this situation the receipts consist of 1) the sales revenue that will be reported on the company\u2019s income statement, and 2) the sales tax that will be reported as a current liability on the company\u2019s balance sheet.) To calculate the true sales revenue, we divide the total receipts (for the items that are subject to sales tax) by \u201c1 + the sales tax rate\u201d. If the sales tax rate is 6%, we divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.06. If the sales tax rate is 7.25%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.0725. To determine the sales tax that was collected and belongs to the state and local governments, multiply the true sales revenue amount times the sales tax rate.", "Example of the Sales Tax Calculation": "As an example, assume that all of the items in a vending machine are subject to a sales tax of 7%. During the most recent month, the vending machine receipts were $481.50. Therefore, $481.50 includes 1) the company\u2019s revenue from the sale of its products, and 2) the sales tax pertaining to the sales revenue. Algebra is used to separate the $481.50 of receipts into the sales revenue and the sales tax on the sales revenue. To illustrate, let S = the sales revenue (which excludes the sales tax) and let 0.07S = the sales tax on the sales revenue. Since the sales revenue + the sales tax = $481.50, we can state this as S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $481.50. We solve for S by dividing $481.50 by 1.07. The result indicates that the true sales revenue was $450. The 7% of sales tax on the true sales revenue is $31.50 ($450 X 0.07). To make sure our math is correct, we add the amounts: $450 of sales revenue + $31.50 of sales tax = $481.50, which agrees with the vending machine receipts.", "Additional Example of the Sales Tax Calculation": "Now let\u2019s assume that another company sold products which are subject to a 7% sales tax. Its receipts were $32,100 which included the sales tax. We designate S as the true sales revenue. Therefore, the sales tax will be 0.07S. As a result, S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $32,100. The sales revenue, S, will be $30,000 ($32,100 divided by 1.07). The sales tax on the sales revenue will be 0.07 X $30,000 = $2,100. Our proof is $30,000 of sales revenue + $2,100 of sales tax = $32,100.

Accounts payable is also referred to as trade payables.", "Definition of Accounts Receivable": "Accounts receivable is a current asset account in which a company records the amounts it has a right to collect from customers who received goods or services on credit.", "Examples of Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable": "Let\u2019s assume that Company A sells merchandise to Company B on credit (with payment due 30 days later). Company A will record the amount of the sale with a credit to Sales and a debit to Accounts Receivable. Company B will record the purchase (perhaps as inventory) with a credit to Accounts Payable. When the amount of the credit sale is remitted, Company B will debit its liability Accounts Payable and will credit Cash. Company A will debit Cash and will credit its current asset Accounts Receivable.

The accrual of an expense will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company\u2019s expenses and increases its current liabilities. The accrual of revenues and assets refers to revenues and/or assets that a company has earned, but the company has not yet received the money nor has it recorded the transaction.

In other words, the company owes money to its creditors and the amounts should be reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet as either a current liability or a non-current (or long-term) liability.", "Examples of a Debtor and a Creditor": "Assume that a company borrows money from its bank. The company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.  If a manufacturer sells merchandise to a retailer with terms of net 30 days, the manufacturer is the creditor and retailer is the debtor.", "Definition of Cost of Goods Sold": "The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that have been sold to customers during the period of the income statement. How the costs flow out of inventory will have an impact on the company\u2019s cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold will likely be the largest expense reported on the income statement.", "Examples of Calculating the Cost of Goods Sold": "One way to calculate a retailer\u2019s cost of goods sold is to begin with the cost of the goods it had purchased during the accounting period and then adjust it for the change in inventory. For example, if 1,000 units of a company\u2019s only product were purchased but its inventory increased by 100 units, then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units of the product  were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold. Using dollar amounts, let\u2019s assume that a retailer\u2019s cost of its merchandise purchases for a year was $300,000 while the cost of its inventory increased from $100,000 to $120,000. The result is that its cost of goods sold is $280,000 (purchases of $300,000 minus the $20,000 increase in inventory). A second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is: the cost of the beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available \u2013 cost of ending inventory. Using the amounts above, we have $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000 \u2013 $120,000 = $280,000. If the cost of the ending inventory were $65,000, the cost of goods sold would have been $335,000 (purchases of $300,000 + the $35,000 decrease in inventory).

In other words, prepaid expenses are costs that have been paid but are not yet used up or have not yet expired. Generally, the amount of prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year are reported on a company\u2019s balance sheet as a current asset. As the amount expires, the current asset is reduced and the amount of the reduction is reported as an expense on the income statement.", "Example of Prepaid Expenses": "A common prepaid expense is the six-month insurance premium that is paid in advance for insurance coverage on a company\u2019s vehicles. The amount paid is often recorded in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance. If the company issues monthly financial statements, its income statement will report Insurance Expense which is one-sixth of the six-month premium. The balance in the account Prepaid Insurance will be the amount that is still prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet.", "Accrued Expenses": "Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.", "Example of an Accrued Expense": "To illustrate an accrued expense, let\u2019s assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.", "Recording an Accrued Expense": "Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company\u2019s financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31.

When it is used as a control account, it will contain only summary amounts, such as total credit sales for a day, total collections from customers for a day, total returns and allowances for a day, and the total amount owed by all customers. Hence, if you want to find the amount that a specific customer still owes for its purchases on credit, it will not be shown in the control account. To find the amount that a specific customer owes, its recent payments, and its recent purchases on credit, you will quickly get that information from the Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger.

During the most recent year, the florist had cash revenues of $100,000, cash expenses of $70,000, and depreciation expense of $8,000. Therefore, the net income reported on its income statement was $22,000. (The depreciation pertains to a truck purchased in an earlier year.)", "Depreciation on the Income Statement": "The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement.  Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.", "Depreciation on the Balance Sheet": "The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.

After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays\u2019 cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.", "Definition of Contra Asset Account": "A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is expected to be a credit balance. It is described as \u201ccontra\u201d because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.)", "Examples of Contra Asset Accounts": "The most common contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is associated with property, plant and equipment (plant assets). Accumulated Depreciation will be credited when Depreciation Expense is recorded. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation means that the cost of the property, plant and equipment will continue to be reported. Looking at the cost of the plant assets and the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation allows us to see how much of the plant assets\u2019 cost has been depreciated and how much has not been depreciated. Another contra asset account is Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account appears next to the current asset Accounts Receivable.\u00a0The account Allowance for Doubtful Account is credited when the account Bad Debts Expense is debited under the allowance method.\u00a0The use of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts allows us to see in Accounts Receivable the total amount that the company has a right to collect from its credit customers. The credit balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts tells us how much of the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is unlikely to be collected. A less common example of a contra asset account is Discount on Notes Receivable. The credit balance in this account is amortized or allocated to Interest Income or Interest Revenue over the life of a note receivable.", "Definition of Debit": "In accounting the term debit indicates the left side of a general ledger account or the left side of a T-account. (The right side of an account or a T-account is the credit side.) Generally asset accounts have debit balances, while liabilities and owner\u2019s (stockholders\u2019) equity accounts have credit balances. This is consistent with the accounting equation where assets = liabilities + owner\u2019s equity. In addition to the asset, liability, and owner\u2019s equity accounts, the accounting system uses temporary accounts to sort and store the transaction amounts involving revenues and expenses. At any point, the balances in the revenue and expense accounts can be moved to the owner\u2019s equity account. Since revenues cause owner\u2019s equity to increase, the revenue accounts will have credit balances. Since expenses cause owner\u2019s equity to decrease, expense accounts will have debit balances. Debits and credits are part of accounting\u2019s double entry system. ", "Examples of Debit": "To illustrate the term debit, let\u2019s assume that a company has cash of $500. Therefore, the company\u2019s general ledger asset account Cash should indicate a debit balance of $500. If the company receives an additional $200, a debit of $200 will be entered and will result in the Cash account having a debit balance of $700. Sometimes the word charge is used in place of debit. For example, if a company spends $300 for advertising, a credit of $300 will be recorded in the Cash account, and an accountant might add \u201c\u2026and charge Advertising Expense for $300.\u201d Another accountant might say \u201c\u2026and debit Advertising Expense for $300.\u201d", "Definition of Reconciling an Account": "Reconciling an account is likely to mean proving or documenting that\u00a0an account balance is correct.", "Examples of Reconciling an Account": "When a company reconciles its bank statement, it is reconciling the balance in its general ledger account Cash (or Cash: Checking Account) with the bank\u2019s information. Prior to issuing a company\u2019s financial statements, it is wise to reconcile every balance sheet account by collecting the information that supports the accounts\u2019 ending balances. For example, the Accounts Receivable balance could begin by comparing the balance with an aging of the accounts receivable.  Another example is reconciling the balance in the general ledger account Utilities Payable. This might be accomplished by computing the daily cost of each utility that the company\u00a0uses. The\u00a0cost per day is then multiplied by\u00a0the number of days since the last meter reading date\u00a0shown on the\u00a0utility\u00a0bills that have already been recorded.", "Definition of Amounts in Parentheses": "Parentheses around a number could have a variety of meanings. For example, parentheses could indicate any of the following:", "Definition of Stocks": "Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates. Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation\u2019s profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation\u2019s board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation\u2019s financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.", "Definition of Bonds": "Bonds payable are a form of long-term debt, which include a formal agreement to pay interest semiannually and the principal amount at maturity. The interest is an expense that reduces the corporation\u2019s earnings and its taxable income.", "Definition of Cost Principle": "The cost principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. It is also known as the historical cost principle.  The cost principle requires that assets be recorded at the cash amount (or the equivalent) at the time that an asset is acquired. Further, the amount recorded will not be increased for inflation or improvements in market value. (An exception is the change in market value of a short-term investment in the capital stock of a corporation whose shares of stock are actively traded on a major stock exchange.)", "Example of Cost Principle": "The cost principle means that a long-term asset purchased for the cash amount of $50,000 will be recorded at $50,000. If the same asset was purchased for a down payment of $20,000 and a formal promise to pay $30,000 within a reasonable period of time and with a reasonable interest rate, the asset will also be recorded at $50,000. A long-term asset that will be used in a business (other than land) will be depreciated based on its cost. The cost will be reported on the balance sheet along with the amount of the asset\u2019s accumulated depreciation. Further, the accumulated depreciation cannot exceed the asset\u2019s cost.  The cost principle prohibits a company from recording an asset that was not acquired in a transaction. Hence, a company cannot report its highly successful management team as an asset nor can it report its highly valuable trademark that it developed over many years. (As a result of the cost principle, some of a company\u2019s most valuable assets will not appear as assets on the company\u2019s balance sheet.) On the other hand, if the company acquires a competitor\u2019s trademark in a $3 million transaction, that trademark will be reported as an asset at its cost of $3 million.", "Definition of Trial Balance": "A trial balance is an internal report that remains in the accounting department. The trial balance lists all of the accounts in the general ledger and their balances (or all of the accounts that have balances). However, the debit balance amounts are entered in one column and the credit balance amounts are entered in another column. Each column is then summed to prove that the total of the debit balances is equal to the total of the credit balances.

For example, companies will have a Cash account in which to record every transaction that increases or decreases the company\u2019s cash. Another account, Sales, will collect all of the amounts from the sale of merchandise. Most accounting systems require that every transaction will affect two or more accounts. For example, a cash sale will increase the Cash account and will increase the Sales account. The term account is also used in transactions where suppliers sell goods to customers and grant credit terms such as net 10 days. In those situations, a supplier is selling goods on account and the customer has purchased goods on account. The supplier has also increased the balance in its current asset account entitled Accounts Receivable and the customer will increase the balance in its current liability account entitled Accounts Payable.", "Definition of Cash Flow Statement": "The cash flow statement (officially known as the statement of cash flows) is one of the required financial statements issued by U.S. businesses (and by not-for-profit organizations). The cash flow statement reports a company\u2019s major cash inflows and cash outflows during the same period as the company\u2019s income statement. The cash flow statement is important because the income statement reflects the accrual method of accounting. This means the income statement reports revenues when they are earned (not when money is received) and expenses and losses when they occur (not when money is paid out). The cash flow statement concludes by showing that its amounts agree to the change in the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents from the beginning to the end of the accounting period. ", "Purpose of Cash Flow Statement": "The purpose of the cash flow statement is to provide the readers of a company\u2019s financial statement with the cash amounts that flowed in and out of the company. This is needed because the accrual basis of accounting requires the income statement to show the revenues that were earned (not the money actually received) and the expenses incurred or matched to the accounting period (not the money actually spent). For example, the money invested by owners and the money received from lenders will not appear on the income statement. Neither will the money spent to repay loans or money spent for equipment or buildings. In addition to the cash amounts arranged into three types of activities (operating, investing, and financing), the cash flow statement discloses the amount of interest paid, the amount of income taxes paid, and significant investing and financing activities that did not require the use of cash.", "Deferred Revenue": "Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company\u2019s balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability. The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).", "Example of Deferred Revenue": "To illustrate deferred revenue, let\u2019s assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received. Now let\u2019s assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues. As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company\u2019s remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).", "Definition of Expense": "An expense is a cost that a company incurs or uses up when it earns revenues.", "Examples of Expenses": "A few examples of the many expenses that a company incurs in earning revenues are:", "Definition of Expenditure": "An expenditure is a payment or disbursement. The expenditure may be for the purchase of an asset, a reduction of a liability, a distribution to the owners, or it could be payment in the same accounting period as the amount becomes an expense.", "Examples of Expenditures": "Examples of expenditures that will not be an expense in the accounting period in which the payments are made include the purchase of land for a future expansion and the principal portion of a monthly loan payment. Here is an example to illustrate the difference between an expense and an expenditure. A company makes an expenditure of $255,500 to purchase equipment. The expenditure occurs on a single day and the equipment is immediately placed in service. Assuming the equipment will be used for seven years, the asset\u2019s cost could be reported on the income statement as depreciation expense of $100 per day for the next 2,555 days (7 years of use).", "Definition of Statement of Financial Position": "The statement of financial position is another name for the balance sheet. It is one of the main financial statements. The statement of financial position reports an entity\u2019s assets, liabilities, and the difference in their totals as of the final moment of an accounting period. The structure of the statement of financial position is similar to the basic accounting equation. For a corporation the format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders\u2019 Equity. A nonprofit organization\u2019s format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets. The statement of financial position must reflect the basic accounting principles and guidelines such as the cost, matching, and full disclosure principle to name a few. Accordingly, the statement of financial position is more meaningful when it is prepared under the accrual method of accounting.", "Examples of Creditors": "Some creditors, such as banks and other lenders, have lent money to the company and will require the company to sign a written promissory note for the amount owed. When a promissory note is required, the company borrowing the money will record and report the amount owed as Notes Payable. If the creditor is a vendor or supplier that did not require the company to sign a promissory note, the amount owed is likely to to be reported as Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities. Other creditors include the company\u2019s employees (who are owed wages and bonuses), governments (who are owed taxes), and customers (who made deposits or other prepayments). Some creditors are referred to as secured creditors because they have a registered lien on some of the company\u2019s assets. A creditor without a lien (or other legal claim) on the company\u2019s assets is an unsecured creditor.", "Definition of Gross Margin": "Gross margin is the amount remaining after a retailer or manufacturer subtracts its cost of goods sold from its net sales. In other words, gross margin is the retailer\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s profit before subtracting its selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses.", "Example of Calculating the Markup on Cost to Earn a Specified Gross Margin": "Since you know the cost of a product and you know the gross margin percentage to be achieved, you can determine the selling price and the markup needed. Let\u2019s begin by assuming that a company\u2019s product has a cost of $75 and the company desires a 25% gross margin (or 25% of the selling price). Let\u2019s use \u201cSP\u201d to indicate the product\u2019s required selling price and \u201cMU$\u201d to represent the gross profit, and state the gross margin as 0.25SP.

Let\u2019s also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner\u2019s equity is likely the company\u2019s net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company\u2019s income statement for the year. Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner\u2019s capital account at the end of the year.", "Definition of Accounting Principles, Assumptions, and Concepts": "The basic underlying accounting principles, assumptions, and concepts include the following:", "Definition of Balance Sheet Accounts": "Balance sheet accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the income statement accounts.)  Balance sheet accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving a company\u2019s assets, liabilities, and owner\u2019s or stockholders\u2019 equity. The balances in these accounts as of the final moment of an accounting year will be reported on the company\u2019s end-of-year balance sheet. Balance sheet accounts are also referred to as permanent or real accounts because at the end of the accounting year the balances in these accounts are not closed. Instead, the ending balances will be carried forward to become the beginning balances in the next accounting year. (This is different from the income statement accounts which are closed at the end of each accounting year and will begin the following year with zero balances.)", "Examples of Balance Sheet Accounts": "Examples of a corporation\u2019s balance sheet accounts include Cash, Temporary Investments, Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Investments, Land, Buildings, Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures,  Accumulated Depreciation, Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Payroll Taxes Payable, Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and others.", "Definition of GAAP": "GAAP is the acronym for the phrase generally accepted accounting principles  or US GAAP. GAAP is required for a U.S. company\u2019s external financial statements. One of the basic underlying principles in GAAP is the cost principle. This means that the inventories, the cost of goods sold, and the resulting net income must reflect the manufacturer\u2019s actual historical costs.", "Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles": "The basic underlying accounting principles consist of the following:", "Why GAAP is Important": "In order for investors, bankers, financial analysts, portfolio managers, etc. to make informed decisions, it is necessary to have financial statements that are consistent and which can be compared to the financial statements of other corporations. This is more likely to occur when there are common rules for financial reporting. When financial statements are distributed by a business or other organization, the common rules that must be followed are known as generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.", "Definition of Noncurrent Asset": "A noncurrent asset is an asset that is not  expected to turn to cash within one year of date shown on a company\u2019s balance sheet. (This assumes that the company has an operating cycle of less than one year.) A noncurrent asset is also known as a long-term asset. Noncurrent assets are reported under the following balance sheet headings:", "Examples of Noncurrent Assets": "Examples of noncurrent or long-term assets include:", "Definition of Accounting Cycle": "The accounting cycle is often described as a process that includes the following steps:", "Accounting Cycle Today": "The above steps were clear in a manual accounting system. However, today these steps are occurring with electronic speed and accuracy within sophisticated yet inexpensive accounting software. The accountant can enter adjusting entries into the software and can instantaneously obtain a complete set of financial statements by simply selecting them from a menu. After reviewing the financial statements, the accountant is able to make additional adjustments and almost immediately obtain the revised reports. The software will also prepare, record, and post the closing entries. It will also reverse adjusting entries that have been designated to be reversed.", "Reasons a Bank Balance Will Differ from a Company\u2019s Balance": "Some of the reasons for a difference between the balance on the bank statement and the balance on the books include:", "How to Document the Differences": "Any items that are already recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger accounts, but have not yet appeared on the bank statement (outstanding checks, deposits in transit), will be noted as an adjustment to the balance per bank statement. Outstanding checks are a deduction to the balance per bank; deposits in transit are an addition to the balance per bank. If an item is on the bank statement but has not yet been entered on the books, the items are noted as an adjustment to the balance per books. Bank service charges, check printing charges, and other electronic deductions that are not yet recorded in the company\u2019s accounts will become deductions from the cash balance per the books. Electronic deposits not yet recorded by the company will become additions to the cash balance per books.", "Definition of Liability": "In accounting and bookkeeping, the term liability refers to a company\u2019s obligation arising from a past transaction.", "Examples of Liabilities": "A few of the more common types of liabilities include:", "Definition of Debt": "When some people use the term debt, they are referring to all of the amounts that a company owes. In other words, they use the term debt to mean total liabilities. Others use the term debt to mean only the formal, written loans and bonds payable.", "Examples of Debt": "As an example of debt meaning the total amount of a company\u2019s liabilities, we look to the debt-to-equity ratio. In the calculation of that financial ratio, debt  means the total amount of liabilities (not merely the amount of short-term and long-term loans and bonds payable). Others use the word debt  to mean only the formal, written financing agreements such as short-term loans payable, long-term loans payable, and bonds payable. This is a good reminder that people have different perspectives and understandings of accounting terms.", "Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment": "Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company\u2019s operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company\u2019s fixed assets or plant assets. Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).", "Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment": "Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets. ", "Definition of Operating Expenses": "Operating expenses are the costs that have been used up (expired) as part of a company\u2019s main operating activities during the period shown in the heading of its income statement.", "Examples of Operating Activities": "Examples of a retailer\u2019s main operating activities involve the buying and selling of merchandise or goods. Therefore, the retailer\u2019s income statement will report the following operating expenses:", "Definition of Revenue": "Revenue is the amount a company receives from selling goods and/or providing services to its customers and clients. A company\u2019s revenue, which is reported on the first line of its income statement, is often described as sales or service revenues. Hence, revenue is the amount earned from customers and clients before subtracting the company\u2019s expenses. ", "Definition of Gain": "In accounting, a gain is the result of a peripheral activity, such as a retailer selling one of its old delivery trucks. A gain occurs when the cash amount (or its equivalent) received is greater than the asset\u2019s carrying amount, which is also referred to as the asset\u2019s book value. For example, if the company receives $3,000 for the old delivery truck, and the truck\u2019s carry amount (book value) at the time of the sale was $600, the company will have a gain of $2,400.", "Definition of Income": "The term income is used differently by many people. For some, income means the money coming in, such as What is your family income? What is your interest and dividend income? Generally, accountants use the term revenue for the gross amount received, but the IRS may use the term income to mean the gross amount received. While accountants use the term revenues when referring to a company\u2019s sales of its merchandise, the same accountants will use the term income to mean the amount a company received in interest and dividends on its investments. The investment interest and dividend amounts earned will be reported on the income statement as other income. To provide more clarity, accountants use the term net income to describe the amount remaining after expenses and losses are subtracted from revenues and gains. However, the income statements of large U.S. corporations will frequently use the term earnings instead of net income. ", "Definition of Write-down in Inventory": "Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.", "Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory": "Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory\u2019s cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the\u00a0amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it\u00a0should be reported as a separate line on the income statement. Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner\u2019s equity or stockholders\u2019 equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner\u2019s or stockholders\u2019 equity.", "Examples of Expense": "Some of the expenses that will be reported on a retailer\u2019s income statement for the month of August include:", "Example of Debtor": "If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.", "Definition of Gross Profit": "Net sales \u2013 Cost of goods sold = gross profit?", "Example of Gross Profit": "Let\u2019s assume that a manufacturer has net sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold (using absorption costing) is $39,000. Therefore, the manufacturer\u2019s gross profit is $21,000 ($60,000 minus $39,000). The gross profit ratio or gross profit percentage is 35% (gross profit of $21,000 divided by net sales of $60,000).", "Definition of Net Profit": "The term net profit might have a variety of definitions. We will assume that net profit means a company\u2019s net sales minus all expenses. The expenses include the cost of goods sold, the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and the nonoperating expenses and losses. Nonoperating revenues and gains would be an increase to the net profit. If the business is a regular corporation, net profit may mean after income tax expense.", "Example of Net Profit": "Assume that a sole proprietorship business had the following information for it most recent year:", "Definitions of Cost and Expense": "Some people use cost interchangeably with expense. However, we use the term cost to mean the amount spent to purchase an item, a service, etc. Some costs are not expenses (cost of land), some costs will become expenses (cost of a new delivery van), and some costs become expenses immediately (airing a television advertisement).", "Examples of Costs and Expenses": "Assume that a company purchases 2,000 units of a supply item each of which has a cost of $5. If none of the units have been used, the current asset supplies will be reported at the cost of $10,000 (2,000 units at $5 each). At the time of the next balance sheet, only 500 of the units are on hand and 1,500 units have been used in the business. As a result, the balance sheet will report the supplies on hand at their cost of $2,500 (500 units at $5) and the income statement will report supplies expense of $7,500 (1,500 units at $5). Assume that a company purchases a delivery truck to be used in its business. Initially the truck\u2019s cost will be recorded in the asset account Delivery Truck. However, the truck\u2019s cost will become Depreciation Expense as the truck is \u201cused up\u201d in the company\u2019s revenue-generating activities.", "Definition of Budgeting": "Budgeting is the process of preparing detailed projections of future amounts. Companies often engage in two types of budgeting:", "Examples of Operational Budgeting": "In a business, the budgeting for operations will include preparing the following projections for the next accounting year:", "Example of Capital Budgeting": "Capital budgeting involves future projects which overlap several or many future accounting periods. Capital budgeting usually means listing each project along with its cash outlays and expected cash inflows for each year. The amounts should be discounted to their present values and also ranked by priority and profitability. Once prepared, the capital budget provides a guide for investing in future fixed assets as well as arranging for the financing of the projects.

The difference between the amount of revenue and the amount of net income is significant. Here are some hypothetical amounts to illustrate the point:", "Calculating Revenue": "The best way to calculate a company\u2019s revenue during an accounting period (year, month, etc.) is to sum up the amounts earned (as opposed to the amounts of cash that were received). For example, if a new company sold $75,000 of goods in December but allows the customer to pay 30 days later, the company\u2019s December sales are $75,000 (even though no cash was received in December). Reporting revenues in the period in which they are earned is known as the accrual basis of accounting. Hence, a company\u2019s revenue could occur before the cash is received, after the cash is received, or at time that the cash is received. (Note that for income tax reporting, smaller companies may use the cash basis of accounting.)", "Examples of Revenue": "Common examples of revenue include:", "Revenue vs Income": "It is important to note that many people use the term income to mean revenue. Perhaps a business owner sees money \u201ccoming in\u201d from customers and logically refers to it as \u201cincome\u201d. However, it is best to use the word sales or revenue when referring to the amounts earned from customers, and to use the word income for an amount that reflects the subtraction of expenses.

The new machine requires routine maintenance of $3,000 each month. This $3,000 is a revenue expenditure since it will be reported on the monthly income statement, thereby being matched with the month\u2019s revenues. Normal repairs to the machine are also a revenue expenditure, since the expenditure does not make the machine more than it was, nor does it extend the machine\u2019s useful life.

As of December 31, the hourly-paid employees have earned $3,000 of wages for which they will be paid on the first Friday in January. In order to comply with the matching principle, the account Wages and Salaries Expense must include the $3,000 of wages in order to match the December wages expense with the December revenues. As a result, the December\u2019s income statement will present an accurate picture of December\u2019s profits and the balance sheet will report the liability for the wages owed as of December 31.", "Definition of Inventory": "Inventory is a very significant current asset for retailers, distributors, and manufacturers. Inventory serves as a buffer between 1) a company\u2019s sales of goods, and 2) its purchases or production of goods. Companies strive to find the proper amount of inventory so that it can meet the fluctuating demand of its customers, avoid disruptions in production, and minimize holding costs. Since the costs of the items purchased or produced are likely to change (especially with inflation), companies must elect a cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and its cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the common cost flow assumptions are FIFO, LIFO, and average. A company\u2019s cost of inventory is related to the company\u2019s cost of goods sold that is reported on the company\u2019s income statement.", "Examples of Inventories": "Retailers and distributors are likely to have one type of inventory, namely merchandise. Manufacturers will have three or four categories of inventories:", "Definition of Depreciation Expense": "Depreciation expense is the systematic allocation of a depreciable asset\u2019s cost to the accounting periods in which the asset is being used. The depreciation of assets used in the manufacturing process are considered to be a product cost and will be allocated or assigned to the goods produced. The allocated depreciation will be included in the inventory cost of the goods manufactured until the goods are sold. When the goods are sold, the cost of goods sold will include the allocated depreciation. The depreciation of assets used in the business but outside of the manufacturing process will be reported as depreciation expense of the accounting periods. Generally, the depreciation of these assets will be part of a company\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). The depreciation of assets used in a company\u2019s peripheral activities will reduce the company\u2019s non-operating (or other) income. ", "Definition of Accumulated Depreciation": "Accumulated depreciation reports  the total amount of depreciation that has been reported on all of the income statements from the time that the assets were put into service until the date of the balance sheet. The account Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account because it will have a credit balance. The credit balance is reported in the property, plant and equipment section of the balance sheet and it reduces the cost of the assets to their carrying value or book value.", "Example of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation": "To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that a retailer purchases new display racks at a cost of $84,000. This asset is estimated to have a useful life of 7 years (84 months) and no salvage value at the end of 7 years. Assuming the retailer uses the straight-line depreciation method, during each month of the display racks\u2019 lives the retailer\u2019s monthly income statement will report depreciation expense of $1,000. However, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be reported on the balance sheet at $1,000 at the end of the first month, $2,000 at the end of the second month, $3,000 at the end of the third month, etc. until the balance in Accumulated Depreciation reaches $84,000 at the end of the 84th month.", "Definition of Costs": "In the context of the question, costs are the amounts paid in exchange for materials, products, or services. The costs could be:", "Examples of Costs Being Expensed": "Costs are reported as expenses  in the accounting period when they are used up, have expired, or have no future economic value which can be measured. For example, the June salaries for the company\u2019s marketing team should be reported as an expense in June since the future economic value cannot be measured/determined. Another example is the amount spent to repair equipment that broke in June and was repaired in June. The cost of the repair merely restored the equipment to its same condition. Since there was no additional future economic value added, the costs of repair is reported as an expense on the June income statement.", "Example of Costs Being Capitalized": "Costs are capitalized (recorded as assets) when the costs have not been used up and have future economic value. Assume that a company incurs a cost of $30,000 in June to add a hydraulic lift to its delivery truck that had no lift. The remaining useful life of the truck and the lift is 5 years. The cost of $30,000 should be capitalized since it added future economic value by making an improvement to the truck. The $30,000 cost increases the company\u2019s assets, but will be reduced by depreciating the cost to expense over the next 5 years.", "Definition of Accounting Equation": "The accounting equation of a sole proprietorship is assets = liabilities + owner\u2019s equity. For a corporation, the accounting equation is assets = liabilities + stockholders\u2019 equity. The accounting equation is similar to the format of the balance sheet. The accounting equation will always remain in balance if the double entry system of accounting is followed accurately.", "Example of the Accounting Equation": "Let\u2019s assume that a person starts a new sole proprietorship business by investing $10,000. The new business will now have: $10,000 of assets = $0 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner\u2019s equity. Next, let\u2019s assume the company purchases equipment at a cost of $3,000 and signs a promise to pay the $3,000 within six months. Now the company\u2019s accounting equation will contain these amounts: $13,000 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner\u2019s equity. Next, let\u2019s assume the new company completes a service for another business and earns revenues of $1,500 and allows the business to pay in 10 days. This means the new company will have an account (or trade) receivable of $1,500 and will have an additional $1,500 of owner\u2019s equity.

(Accounting years of January 1 through December 31 are known as calendar years.) A fiscal year could be a 12-month period of time or a 52/53-week period of time. One reason a U.S. business or other organization will have its accounting year end on a date other than December 31 is to coincide with its natural business year.

As a result, the December 31 balance sheet will be reporting that $97,000 will be turning to cash. During the first 30 days of January the company does not have any other information on bad accounts receivable. However, on January 31 the company learns that an additional $1,000 of its accounts receivable may not be collected. Therefore, on January 31 the company will make an adjusting entry to debit Bad Debts Expense for $1,000 and to credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $1,000. After this entry is recorded, the company\u2019s income statement for the month of January will report Bad Debts Expense of $1,000 and its January 31 balance sheet will report a credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $4,000.", "Definition of Unpresented Cheque or Check": "An unpresented cheque is a check that a company has written, but the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. An unpresented check\u00a0is also referred to as an outstanding\u00a0check or a check that has not yet cleared the bank.

Assume that the cost of goods available for the year 2023 was $240,000. If the company shows too little of that cost as its ending inventory (say $15,000 instead of $25,000), it will mean that too much cost will appear on the 2023 income statement as the cost of goods sold ($225,000 instead of $215,000). The formula for the gross profit is: Net sales \u2013 cost of goods sold = gross profit. If net sales for 2023 were $300,000, the gross profit will be incorrectly reported as $75,000 ($300,000 \u2013 $225,000) instead of the true amount of $85,000 ($300,000 \u2013 $215,000). In 2024, the amount of the beginning inventory is the amount reported as the ending inventory of 2023  ($15,000 instead of $25,000). If the net purchases during 2024 are $270,000, the cost of goods available will be $285,000 (instead of $295,000). After subtracting the 2024 ending inventory of $30,000, the cost of goods sold will be $255,000 (instead of $265,000). This means that the cost of goods sold for 2024 will be too low by $10,000. If net sales are $325,000, the gross profit will be $70,000 ($325,000 \u2013 $255,000) instead of $60,000 ($325,000 \u2013 $265,000). This means the gross profit will too low. Recap: the gross profit in 2023 was understated by $10,000 ($75,000 instead of the true $85,000). The gross profit in 2024 was overstated by $10,000 ($70,000 instead of the true $60,000). One error in calculating the ending inventory of 2023 caused the individual income statements of 2023 and 2024 to report incorrect gross profits and incorrect net incomes.

", "Definition of Receipts": "A company\u2019s receipts  refers to the cash that the company received.", "Examples of Receipts": "The following are some examples of receipts which are not revenues:", "Example of Both a Revenue and a Receipt": "When a company makes a $200 cash sale (or performs services for $200 of cash) the company has earned revenue of $200 and has a receipt of $200.", "Definition of Financial Statement": "Generally, the term financial statement could be referring to:", "Examples of Financial Statements": "The external financial statements issued by U.S. corporations should include all of the following:", "Definition of Paid-in Capital": "Paid-in capital is one of the major categories of stockholders\u2019 equity. Generally, paid-in capital reports the amount that a corporation received from its stockholders (or shareholders) in exchange for the newly issued shares of its capital stock.  Paid-in capital is also referred to as contributed capital and as permanent capital.", "Definition of Retained Earnings": "Retained earnings is one component of the stockholders\u2019 equity section of a corporation\u2019s balance sheet. Some refer to retained earnings as reinvested earnings since this part of the corporation\u2019s cumulative earnings have not been distributed to the corporation\u2019s stockholders in the form of cash dividends.", "Example of General Journal and General Ledger": "Assume that a company depreciates its equipment at a rate of $10,000 per year. In the general journal the company enters the following information:", "Fixed Assets are Part of Noncurrent Assets": "Fixed assets are one of several categories of noncurrent assets. Fixed assets are usually reported on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment. Noncurrent or long-term assets consist of the following:", "Definition of Net Cash Flow": "Net cash flow is the combination of the cash received and the cash disbursed. In other words, it is the combination of the debit amounts coming into a company\u2019s Cash account and the credit amounts going out of the Cash account.", "Examples of Net Cash Flows": "The net cash flows include the cash inflows such as the money received from customers who purchased products on credit in an earlier accounting period, cash sales occurring in the current accounting period, money received from a bank loan, money received from disposing of an old asset, etc.  The net cash flows also include the cash outflows such as paying for new equipment, paying for goods and services from the last accounting period, repaying bank loans, making a temporary investment, etc. ", "Example of Net Income": "Assume ABCO Consulting Company earns $100,000 in mid-December but allows the customer to pay in January. ABCO\u2019s net income is increased in December, but its Cash account will not increase until January. Next assume that ABCO acquires extensive electronic equipment in December for a cash payment of $40,000 and depreciates the equipment\u2019s cost over 5 years. In December, ABCO will have very little depreciation expense, which means a small reduction in its December\u2019s net income. However, ABCO\u2019s Cash account will be reduced by $40,000 in December.", "Reconciling Net Cash Flow vs. Net Income": "As a result of the difference between a company\u2019s net income and the change in a company\u2019s cash balance, the statement of cash flows is required to be issued along with the income statement and the other required financial statements.", "Definition of Par Value Stock": "Some states\u2019 laws require or may have required common stock issued by corporations residing in their states to have a par value. If a par value is required, the corporation will likely assign a very small amount per share of common stock. The par value is also referred to as the corporation\u2019s legal capital. On the other hand, if a corporation issues preferred stock, this stock\u2019s par value is meaningful since its dividends are expressed as a percentage of the preferred stock\u2019s par value.", "Examples of Stock with Par Values": "If a corporation\u2019s common stock has a par value, the par value of an issued share of common stock must be recorded in an account separate from the amount received over and above the amount of par value. For example, if a corporation issues 100 new shares of its common stock for a total of $2,000\u00a0and the stock\u2019s par value is $1 per share, the accounting entry is a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock\u2014Par $100, and a credit to Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par for $1,900. In total the Cash account increased by $2,000 and the paid-in capital reported under stockholders\u2019 equity increased by a total of $2,000 ($100 + $1,900). If a corporation issues 500 shares of 5% preferred stock with a par value of $100 per share and receives $50,000, the entry will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit 5% Preferred Stock for $50,000. The corporation agrees to pay the preferred stockholders dividends of $2,500 (par value of $50,000 X 5%) each year.", "Example of Stock with No Par Value": "If a corporation is not required to have a par value (or a stated value) for its common stock and the corporation issues 100 shares for $2,000, the accounting entry will debit Cash for $2,000 and will credit Common Stock for $2,000.", "Purchases Account Under the Periodic Inventory System": "The general ledger account Purchases is used to record the purchases of inventory items under the periodic inventory system. Under the periodic system the account Inventory will have no entries until it is adjusted at the end of the accounting year so that it reports the cost of the ending inventory. Under the periodic system, the cost in the account Purchases will be added to the cost of the beginning inventory to arrive at the cost of goods available. The cost of the ending inventory is computed through a physical count (or an estimate) and is subtracted from the cost of goods available to arrive at the cost of goods sold.", "Inventory Account Under the Perpetual Inventory System": "The account Purchases is nonexistent with the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the cost of inventory items purchased are recorded directly into the account Inventory. Under the perpetual system, the costs of the goods sold are removed from the account Inventory when the goods are sold and are recorded in the account Cost of Goods Sold. As a result, the balance in the account Inventory should be the cost of the ending inventory.", "Ways to Record One-Year Subscriptions": "Let\u2019s assume that the cost of the one-year subscription for a monthly trade publication is $120. Let\u2019s also assume the payment is made at the start of the subscription period, and that\u00a0your company prepares monthly financial statements. One way to enter the transaction is to debit the current asset Prepaid Subscriptions for $120 and to credit Cash for $120. At the end of each month an adjusting entry would be prepared to debit Subscriptions Expense for $10 and to credit Prepaid Subscriptions for $10. This approach would obviously match the annual cost to each of the 12 monthly periods benefiting from the subscription. However, this is not practical given the small amount involved. Thanks to the accounting concept of materiality, accountants can ignore the matching principle when the amount is insignificant in relationship to the company\u2019s size. Since no investor or lender would be misled if the entire $120 appeared as an expense in one month and $0 appeared in the other 11 months, the following entry would be more practical: debit Subscriptions Expense for\u00a0$120 and credit Cash for $120 at the time of entering the invoice into the accounting records. If an annual trade group membership fee is $6,000 and the amount is significant for the company, the company should record the payment as a prepaid asset and then write a monthly adjusting entry for $500.", "Definition of Liability Account": "A liability account is a general ledger account in which a company records the following which resulted from business transactions:", "Examples of Liability Accounts": "Common liability accounts used with the accrual method of accounting include:", "Reasons for Monthly Accruals": "Accrual adjusting entries are needed monthly only if a company issues monthly financial statements. Two reasons for the monthly accrual adjusting entries are:", "Profit\u2019s Effect on the Balance Sheet": "The profit or net income belongs to the owner of a sole proprietorship or to the stockholders of a corporation. If a company prepares its balance sheet in the account form, it means that the assets are presented on the left side or debit side. The liabilities and owner\u2019s equity (or stockholders\u2019 equity) are presented on the right side or credit side. Recall that the balance sheet reflects the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity.", "Example of Profit\u2019s Effect on the Balance Sheet": "Assume that you own and operate a sole proprietorship. You provided a service to a client and earned revenues of $900 and had no expenses. One of the business assets (cash or accounts receivable) increased and the liabilities did not change. As a result, the owner\u2019s equity (the owner\u2019s capital account) increases. Accountants do prepare an income statement or P&L to report the revenues and expenses, but the ultimate effect of a positive amount of profit or net income is to increase the business\u2019s assets and owner\u2019s equity.", "Definition of Sole Proprietorship Drawing Account": "The drawing or withdrawal account for a sole proprietorship is a temporary owner equity\u2019s account that is closed at the end of the accounting year. The drawing account is also a contra account to owner\u2019s equity, because the drawing account\u2019s debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance for an owner\u2019s equity account. At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed directly to the capital account with an entry that debits the owner\u2019s capital account and credits the owner\u2019s drawing account. Please note that the owner\u2019s drawing account is not an expense and as a result it does not get closed to the Income Summary account nor will the amount appear on the company\u2019s income statement.", "Example of the Entry to Close the Drawing Account": "Let\u2019s assume that at the end of the accounting year the account Eve Jones, Drawing has a debit balance of $24,000. This balance is the result of Eve withdrawing $2,000 per month from her sole proprietorship for her personal use. (The monthly withdrawals were recorded with a debit to Eve Jones, Drawing and a credit to Cash.) The journal entry to close the drawing account at the end of the accounting year will credit Eve Jones, Drawing for $24,000 and will debit Eve Jones, Capital for $24,000.", "Definition of Inventoriable Costs": "Inventoriable costs are:", "Examples of Inventoriable Costs": "Assume that a retailer purchases an item for resale by paying $20 to the supplier. The item is purchased FOB shipping point, which means that the retailer must pay the freight from the supplier to its location. If the freight cost is $1, then the retailer\u2019s inventoriable cost of the item is $21. [If this is the only item in the retailer\u2019s inventory, the retailer\u2019s balance sheet will report inventory at a cost of $21. When the item is sold, the retailer\u2019s inventory will decrease by $21, and the $21 will be reported on its income statement as the cost of goods sold.] In the case of a manufacturer, assume one of its product\u2019s required the following costs: direct materials of $6, direct labor of $4, and manufacturing overhead of $7. This manufacturer\u2019s inventoriable cost (or product cost) is $17. The $17 will be part of the manufacturer\u2019s inventory until it is sold. When it is sold, the $17 will be removed from inventory and will become part of the manufacturer\u2019s cost of goods sold.", "Examples of Balance Sheet Elements": "Assets that are reported on the balance sheet are the company\u2019s resources such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, investments, land, buildings, equipment, some intangible assets . Generally assets are reported at their cost or a lower amount due to the cost principle, depreciation, and conservatism. The cost principle also means that some very valuable aspects of the company are not listed as assets. For example, a company\u2019s outstanding reputation, its effective management team, and its amazing brand recognition are not reported as assets if they were not acquired in a transaction involving another party or entity. Liabilities are a company\u2019s obligations as of the balance sheet date and will include loans payable, accounts payable, accrued expenses not yet recorded in accounts payable, warranty obligations, taxes payable, and more. Stockholders\u2019 equity or owner\u2019s equity reports the amounts that were invested by the owners plus the company\u2019s earnings that the owners chose not to withdraw as dividends or drawings.", "Additional Balance Sheet Information": "The balance sheet classifications allow the reader to easily compute the amount of a company\u2019s working capital and to determine if a company is highly leveraged. Every balance sheet that is distributed by a company should include notes (or footnote disclosures). These notes provide important additional information concerning the company\u2019s financial position including potential liabilities not included in the amounts reported on the face of the balance sheet.", "Definition of Debits and Credits": "Debits and credits are terms used in accounting and bookkeeping systems for the past five centuries. They are part of the double entry system which results in every business transaction affecting at least two accounts. At least one of the accounts will receive a debit entry and at least one other account will receive a credit entry. Further, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits. You should think of a debit as an entry on the left side of an account, and a credit as an entry on the right side of another account. Accountants often use T-accounts to visualize the debit and credit effects on the accounts\u2019 balances. It may take some time to learn which general ledger accounts will be debited and credited, but here are some general rules:", "Examples of Debits and Credits": "To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company will enter $10,000 as a debit in its Cash account and a credit of $10,000 in its Notes Payable account. If the company pays $300 for an ad to air on the radio, the company will enter $300 as a debit in the Advertising Expense account and will enter $300 as a credit in its Cash account.", "How a Rent Payment Affects the Accounting Equation": "A company\u2019s payment of each month\u2019s rent reduces the company\u2019s asset Cash. This is recorded with a credit to Cash. If the payment is for the current month\u2019s rent, the second account is to the temporary account Rent Expense which will be debited. The debit to Rent Expense also causes owner\u2019s equity (or stockholders\u2019 equity) to decrease. Eventually, the balances in the company\u2019s temporary accounts will actually be transferred/closed to the owner\u2019s capital account (or to a corporation\u2019s retained earnings account within stockholders\u2019 equity). To recap the above, the monthly rent payment keeps the sole proprietor\u2019s accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity, in balance because it reduces the company\u2019s assets and it reduces the company\u2019s owner\u2019s equity.", "Definition of Sales Commissions": "Sales commissions are amounts earned by selling another company\u2019s goods or services and paid by the company whose goods or services were sold. The amounts earned/paid are often based on dollars of sales or number of units sold. The company responsible for paying the sales commissions will report a selling expense. It will also report a liability for any unpaid commissions. The company or person that did the selling will report revenues or income for the amount earned. It will also report a receivable for any commissions earned but not yet received.", "Examples of Sales Commission": "Under the accrual basis of accounting (as opposed to the cash basis) the parties involved should record the sales commissions as follows:", "Accounting Entry When Signing a Contract": "Merely signing a contract does not by itself require a journal entry. In other words, signing a contract for a future transaction does not mean the company is increasing or decreasing an asset or a liability at the time of the signing. Of course, if cash or some other asset is exchanged at the time of the signing, it will have to be recorded. While a journal entry is not required at the time the contract is signed, significant commitments that are contained in the contract must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the parties to a noncancelable contract.", "Examples of No Entry When Signing a Contract": "Assume that an electric utility signs a noncancelable contract with a coal company to purchase 100 million tons of coal to be delivered over a one-year period that will begin in three months. On the day the contract is signed, the electric utility does not own any of the coal specified in the contract, nor does it owe for any of the coal, since the coal will not be delivered for at least three months. When the first trainload of coal arrives at the electric utility at least three months later, the utility will record the purchase of only the coal that has arrived and the related account payable. Likewise, on the day the contract is signed, the coal company does not have a sale of the coal specified in the contract, and it does not have a receivable from the electric utility. Three months later, when the first shipment of coal is delivered to the utility, the coal company will record a sale of the coal and a related account receivable. If the commitments made by the utility and the coal company are significant, those commitments must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of both the utility and the coal company.

Revenues are the amounts earned before deducting expenses (cost of goods sold, SG&A) and losses. Revenues are sometimes referred to as the top line amount on a company\u2019s income statement. Earnings  or net income are often referred to as the bottom line amount on the income statement, since it is the remainder after subtracting the cost of goods sold, SG&A, non-operating expenses, and losses from the revenues (both operating revenues and nonoperating revenues and gains).

For the recent year the corporation\u2019s revenues were $410,000 and its earnings were $41,000.", "Why Rent Expense is a Debit": "Rent expense (and any other expense) will reduce a company\u2019s owner\u2019s equity (or stockholders\u2019 equity). Owner\u2019s equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to reduce the credit balance, the expense accounts will require debit entries.", "Example of Rent Expense as a Debit": "If a company pays $800 for the current month\u2019s rent, the company\u2019s assets and its owner\u2019s equity will decrease. To decrease an asset such as Cash, the company will credit the Cash account for $800. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, the company will need to debit another account for $800. In this case, the account is Rent Expense. (Eventually the debit balance in the Rent Expense account will be transferred/closed to the proprietor\u2019s capital account or to a corporation\u2019s retained earnings account.)", "Why Service Revenues is a Credit": "Service revenues (and any other revenues) will increase a company\u2019s owner\u2019s equity (or stockholders\u2019 equity). Owner\u2019s equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to increase the credit balance, the revenues accounts will have to be credited.", "Example of Service Revenues as a Credit": "If the company earns and receives $300 for providing a service, the company\u2019s assets and owner\u2019s equity will increase. The asset Cash will be increased with a debit of $300. Therefore, another account will need to be credited. In this case Service Revenues will be credited for $300. Service Revenues is a temporary account that will eventually be closed to the owner\u2019s equity account.", "Definition of Accrued Revenues": "Accrued revenues include service revenues, interest income, sales of goods, etc. which have been earned by a business, but the transactions are not yet fully processed and therefore are not recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger accounts. If it is the end of the accounting period, these amounts must be recorded to comply with the accrual method of accounting. By entering these on an adjusting entry dated for the last day of the accounting period, the amounts will be included on the period\u2019s financial statements.", "Example of Recording Accrued Revenues": "Assume your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The loan agreement specifies that the $100,000 is to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, your company has not billed the supplier for the interest since it is not due until February 28. However, as of December 31, your company has earned $1,000 of interest (1/3 of $3,000). For the December financial statements to report the amount earned, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and credits $1,000 to Interest Income (an income statement account).", "Definition of Profit": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, profit is the amount of revenues earned minus the amount of expenses incurred.

The intended result is for each temporary account to begin the next accounting year with a zero balance. The temporary accounts include the income statement accounts (revenue, expense, gain, loss, income summary) and also the drawing account of a sole proprietorship.

It also incurs $2,000 of expenses of which it pays $1,100 immediately and will pay $900 in 30 days. In its first month, the company had a profit of $8,000 (revenues of $10,000 minus $2,000 of expenses), but its cash decreased by $1,100 (cash receipts of $0 with cash payments of $1,100). If it has no other business transactions, the company\u2019s profit in the second month will be $0 (no revenues minus no expenses) but it will have a $9,100 increase in cash (receipts of $10,000 minus payments of $900). Now assume that a different company had a profit of $60,000 in its first year, but paid out $65,000 near the end of the year to acquire equipment that will be put into service on the first day of its second year. During its first year the company had $65,000 of profit, but may end the year with $0 cash. Other examples where cash is paid out, but the profits are not reduced at the time of the payment, include prepayments of insurance premiums, payments to increase its inventory of merchandise, and payments to reduce liabilities.

The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later.  The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large corporations. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.)

(On June 13, the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)", "Definition of Prepaid Insurance": "Generally, Prepaid Insurance is a current asset account that has a debit balance. The debit balance indicates the amount that remains prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet. As time passes, the debit balance decreases as adjusting entries credit the account Prepaid Insurance and debit Insurance Expense.", "Example of a Credit Balance in Prepaid Insurance": "Assume that a company\u2019s annual premium on its liability insurance policy is $2,400 and is due on the first day of each year. Also assume that the company prepares monthly financial statements. When the $2,400 payment is made on January 1, the company debits Prepaid Insurance and credits Cash. It also sets up automatic monthly adjusting entries to debit Insurance Expense for $200 and to credit Prepaid Insurance for $200 on the last day of each month.  On July 1, the company receives a premium refund of $120 from the insurance company. The company records the refund with a debit to Cash and a credit to Prepaid Insurance. The recurring monthly adjusting entries are not changed. At December 31, the balance in Prepaid Insurance will be a credit balance of $120, consisting of the debit of $2,400 on January 1, the 12 monthly credits of $200 each, and the $120 credit on July 1. Prior to issuing the December 31 financial statements, the company must remove the $120 credit balance in Prepaid Insurance by debiting Prepaid Insurance and crediting Insurance Expense. Since adjusting entries involve a balance sheet account and an income statement account, it is wise to monitor the balances in both Prepaid Insurance and Insurance Expense throughout the year. The amount that has not yet expired should be the balance in Prepaid Insurance. The amount that has expired should be reported as Insurance Expense.", "Definition of Statement of Activities": "The statement of activities is one of the main financial statements issued by a nonprofit organization. It is prepared instead of the income statement issued by a for-profit business. The statement of activities focuses on the total organization (as opposed to focusing on specific funds within the organization) and reports the following:", "Example of Statement of Activities": "The following is an example of a nonprofit\u2019s statement of activities. ", "Definition of ERP": "In accounting, ERP is the acronym for enterprise resource planning. ERP could be described as a database software package that supports all of a business\u2019s processes and operations including manufacturing, marketing, financial, human resources, and so on. In other words, the goal of ERP is to have one integrated system for the entire company. The integration of all of a company\u2019s information from all departments, processes, operations, etc. requires that an ERP system be very sophisticated. This in turn requires a company to commit considerable resources for planning, training, and implementing an ERP system.", "Examples of ERP": "Two of the suppliers or vendors of major ERP systems include SAP and Oracle.", "Definition of a Credit": "In bookkeeping and accounting, a credit likely refers to the amount entered on the right side of a general ledger account or to the right side of a T-account.  A credit could also be a verb that means the act of recording an amount on the right side of an account. When an account balance is on the right side of an account, we say the account has a credit balance. A credit entry in an asset account will reduce the account\u2019s usual debit balance.\u00a0 A credit entry in a revenue, liability, or owner\u2019s equity account will increase the account\u2019s normal credit balance. When a bank credits a company\u2019s checking account, the bank\u2019s liability account Customer Deposits is increased. However, the company must debit its Cash account to increase the company\u2019s asset Cash. Credit can also refer to loans, such as line of credit, letter of credit, credit rating, and so on.", "Example of a Credit": "Assume that a company uses $4,000 to purchase office equipment. Since the company\u2019s Cash balance is decreased, the company will credit the account Cash for $4,000 and will debit the asset Office Equipment account for $4,000. If a company issues a credit memo for $100 to one of its customers, the company will credit its current asset account Accounts Receivable for $100 and will debit a contra revenue account such as Sales Returns and Allowances.", "Definition of Unearned Revenue": "In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to money received prior to being earned. It is also referred to as deferred revenue.", "Example of Unearned Revenue": "Assume that ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2023 in exchange for promising to provide the client with services for the year January 1 through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023 the entire $24,000 is unearned. Therefore, ABC\u2019s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 must report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2024 ABC must move $2,000 each month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement. This deferring of revenue to the periods in which it is earned will often be recorded by using the liability account Deferred Revenues. The monthly entry for $2,000 is often described as a deferral adjusting entry.", "Definition of Unrecorded Revenue": "Unrecorded revenue implies that the revenue has been earned, but not yet recorded in a company\u2019s accounting records.", "Example of Unrecorded Revenue": "It is common for an electric utility to provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers\u2019 meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of expenses (cost of fuel and other operating expenses) without the related revenue being reported. Therefore, at each balance sheet date, the utility must accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an accurual adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.", "Depreciation and the Statement of Cash Flows": "The florist\u2019s statement of cash flows (using the indirect method) begins with the net income of $22,000. Next, the depreciation expense of $8,000 is shown as a positive amount and is added to the net income to arrive at $30,000, which equals the cash receipts of $100,000 minus cash expenses of $70,000. Depreciation expense was added to the net income because the depreciation expense had reduced net income but cash was not reduced. In other words, the positive $8,000 of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it is merely a needed adjustment to convert the accrual net income to the cash provided from the florist\u2019s operating activities.    While the amount of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it does reduce a corporation\u2019s taxable income. That in turn reduces a profitable corporation\u2019s cash payments for income taxes (by the amount of the corporation\u2019s income tax rate). The savings of income tax payments is equivalent to a source of cash.", "Example of Crediting Sales": "Recall that asset accounts normally have debit balances and the liability and stockholders\u2019 equity accounts normally have credit balances. To confirm that crediting the Sales account is logical, think of a $100 cash sale. The asset account Cash is debited for $100 and therefore the Sales account will have to be credited for $100. Also the accounting equation will remain in balance because the asset Cash is increased $100 with a debit, and through the closing entries the owner\u2019s or stockholders\u2019 equity account will be increased with a credit of $100.", "Definition of Credit Balance": "A credit balance refers to the balance on the right side of a general ledger account or T-account.  Normally, the liability and owner\u2019s (stockholders\u2019) equity accounts have credit balances. In other words, their balances are on the right side of the accounts similar to their position in the accounting equation: assets = liabilities + owner\u2019s equity. The revenue accounts (which are temporary accounts) also have credit balances because revenues cause the owner\u2019s equity account balances to increase.  Contra asset accounts and contra expense accounts will also have credit balances.", "Example of Accounts Where Credit is Not the Normal Balance": "Accounts where a credit balance is NOT the normal balance include the following:", "Definition of Prepaid Insurance as a Short-term Asset": "Prepaid insurance is usually a short term or current asset because insurance premiums are rarely billed for periods greater than one year. Annual or semiannual insurance premiums are typical.  As the prepaid amount expires, the company will reduce the asset account Prepaid Insurance with a credit entry and will debit Insurance Expense. (If the company arranges for its insurance premiums to be paid monthly, it is possible to have no prepaid amount.)", "Definition of a Short-term or Current Asset": "For most industries, a company\u2019s current assets are defined as cash and other assets that will turn to cash or will\u00a0be used up or consumed within one year of the balance sheet date. If a company is in an industry where the operating cycle is longer than one year, the company\u2019s current assets are cash and assets that will be converted to cash or be used up/consumed during the operating cycle.", "Example of Prepaid Insurance": "Assume that on December 1, a newly formed company pays $600 for insurance coverage for the six months ending on June 1. As of December 31, the company will report Insurance Expense of $100 and its current asset Prepaid Insurance will report $500. The prepaid amount informs the readers of the December 31 balance sheet that the company will not have to pay $500 in cash for insurance during the next five months.", "Definition of Expenses and Payments": "Under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are costs that have been used up or have been incurred in the process of earning revenues and/or operating a business.  A payment is a disbursement of money (usually in the form of a check or currency). Some payments are current period expenses (e.g. current month\u2019s rent payment) but many payments are not expenses of the current period.", "Examples of Expenses and Payments": "The following are some examples of expenses that will not require a payment in the current accounting period:", "Definition of Inventory Cost": "Inventories are reported at cost, not at selling prices. A retailer\u2019s inventory cost is the cost to purchase the items from a supplier plus any other costs to get the items to the retailer. A manufacturer\u2019s inventory consists of the cost to produce the items (the costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead). Sometimes a company\u2019s inventory cost has to be reduced to a lower amount known as the net realizable value (NRV).  Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is reduced to the NRV, the amount of the write down is reported as a loss on the income statement. (There are a few industries where it is acceptable to report the inventory at its net realizable value instead of at its cost.)", "Examples of Inventory Cost": "Assume that a retailer purchases 100 units of a product for $30 per unit. In addition, the retailer must pay a freight bill of $200 to get the products from the supplier to the retailer\u2019s location. These products will be included in inventory at their cost of $3,200. A manufacturer produces a batch of 100 units of Product X23 by using the following costs: materials $600, direct labor $700, and manufacturing overhead $1,200. The 100 units of X23 will be included in inventory at their production cost of $2,500.  Since the unit cost of items purchased or produced may be increasing with inflation, the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory to become part of the cost of goods sold. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.", "Definition of Accrued Liabilities": "Accrued liabilities are usually expenses that have been incurred by a company as of the end of an accounting period, but the amounts have not yet been paid or recorded in the general ledger. Accrued liabilities are recorded at the end of the accounting period by means of  adjusting entries. The amounts for some accrued liabilities and their related expenses (or losses) may have to be estimated.", "Examples of Accrued Liabilities": "Some examples of accrued liabilities include the following:", "Definition of Valuing Inventory": "Generally, the financial statements of a U.S. company must report its inventory at its historical cost (not at its selling prices). Inventories are to be reported at less than the historical cost if the net realizable value of the inventories is lower than the cost. Companies should physically count their inventories at least once a year and the calculations reviewed carefully since the cost of the inventory is critical in the calculation of a company\u2019s profits and working capital.", "Examples of Ways to Value Inventory": "Since the costs of products are likely to change during an accounting year (seems there is always some inflation), a company must select a cost flow assumption that will be used consistently. Examples of cost flow assumptions that U.S. companies use include:", "Abbreviation for Debit and Credit": "The abbreviation for debit is dr. and the abbreviation for credit is cr. Apparently the \u201cdr.\u201d is associated with the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago, rather than the word \u201cdebit\u201d which we use today.", "Definition of Cash Flow and Funds Flow Statements": "The cash flow statement, known formally as the Statement of Cash Flows, reports a company\u2019s change in cash and cash equivalents from one balance sheet date to another. The major cash flows are presented in one of three classifications:", "Example of Cash Flow Statement": "The cash flow statement reports the following financial information:", "Definition of New Machine\u2019s Effect on Profit": "The purchase of a new machine that will be used in a business will affect the profit and loss statement (income statement) when the machine is placed into service and the depreciation expense begins. This expense will reduce the company\u2019s profits (net income, earnings). There may also be some additional revenues and costs, and perhaps cost savings, that will also affect the profits reported on the income statement. Since depreciation spreads the machine\u2019s cost to depreciation expense over the life of the machine, the impact on the company\u2019s profit may be relatively small in the first accounting year compared to the cost of the machine. ", "Example of New Machine\u2019s Effect on Profit": "Assume that a company\u2019s accounting year ends on December 31 of each year. On July 1, the company purchases a new machine for $300,000 that is expected to have no salvage value at the end of its 10-year useful life. If the company uses the straight-line method of depreciation, the depreciation expense in the first accounting year will be $15,000 ($300,000/10 years = $30,000 per year X 1/2 year). For the next nine accounting years the depreciation expense will be $30,000 and then $15,000 in the final accounting year. If the machine is used by a manufacturer, the depreciation, electricity, and maintenance of the machine will be part of manufacturing overhead. This overhead is assigned to (and will cling to) the products manufactured. If the products are in inventory, their cost (including some of the machine\u2019s depreciation) will be part of the inventory. When the products are sold, the overhead costs (including some of the machine\u2019s depreciation) will be part of the cost of goods sold shown on the income statement.", "Definition of an Asset Account": "An asset account is a general ledger account used to sort and store the debit and credit amounts from a company\u2019s transactions involving the company\u2019s resources. The balances in the asset accounts will be summarized and reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet. Generally, the asset account balances are debit balances and are increased with a debit entry and decreased with a credit entry.", "Examples of Asset Accounts": "Some examples of asset accounts include Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Buildings, Equipment, Vehicles, Goodwill, and many more. Two asset accounts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation, are known as contra asset accounts since these accounts are expected to have credit balances.", "Asset Accounts Are Permanent or Real Accounts": "Asset accounts are referred to as permanent or real accounts since they are not closed at the end of the accounting year. Instead, each asset account\u2019s balance at the end of the accounting year is carried forward to become the beginning balance of the next accounting year.", "Advantage of Historical Cost for Property, Plant and Equipment": "An advantage of reporting the historical cost is that the amount is objective, unbiased, verifiable, and therefore easily audited. The reason is that there will be lots of documentation such as contracts, invoices, payments, transfer taxes, and so on. On the other hand, reporting the current value (instead of historical cost) of these assets is more subjective and could lead to some exaggerated amounts.  Outside of the financial statements amounts, companies could get estimated current or replacement values from appraisers.", "Example of Petty Cash Affecting Expenses": "Assume that the petty cash money is used to pay postage of $10. While the company incurs this cost at the time of payment, it will be recorded in the general ledger account Postage Expense when the petty cash fund is replenished.  In order to get the expenses entered in the proper accounting period, it is necessary to replenish the petty cash fund at the end of each accounting period. (This is done in addition to replenishing the fund whenever the currency and coins are low.)", "Definition of Employee Loan": "When a company lends money to one of its employees, the company is reducing its Cash and increasing another asset such as Other Receivables-Advances to Employees (if a note is not involved) or Notes Receivable from Employees. ", "Example of Employee Loan": "Assume an employee\u2019s car needs an $800 repair and the employee does not have the money. The company employer agrees to give the employee an $800 advance to pay for the repair. The accounting entry made by the company in its general ledger accounts is as follows:", "Definition of Cost and Price": "In accounting, the term cost  can mean the cash or cash equivalent amount a company paid to acquire an asset or the amount of an expense it incurred. A manufacturer\u2019s product cost is the cost of the product\u2019s materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Some manufacturers use standard costs in their accounting system.  The term price  is used when referring to the amount that a seller has established for its products. Accountants might state that a product\u2019s selling price is equal to its costs + profit. However, the terms cost and price are often used interchangeably.", "Example of Cost and Price": "To illustrate that the terms cost and price might be used interchangeably (even by accountants) we provide the following example\u2026 Best Supply Company sold 10,000 pounds of materials to Mack Manufacturing Co. for $3 per pound. Mack recorded the materials in its Materials Inventory account at its standard cost of $2.80 per pound. The difference between Mack\u2019s actual cost of $3 per pound and Mack\u2019s standard cost per pound of $2.80 times 10,000 pounds is a $2,000 cost variance for Mack. However, accountants refer to this unfavorable cost variance as a materials purchase price variance.", "Definition of Reserve": "Many decades ago, U.S. accountants decided to eliminate the word reserve when reporting the balances in contra asset accounts. The accounting profession felt that the word reserve might be interpreted to mean that money had been set aside to replace certain assets. ", "Examples of Past Use of Reserve": "Two examples where the term reserve had been used include the following contra asset accounts:", "Definition of Provision": "The term provision is sometimes used by corporations when reporting an expense that is an estimated or uncertain amount. Two examples include Provision for Doubtful Account Expense and Provision for Income Tax Expense. NOTE: While some accountants use the term provision to describe the current year expense/increase in an account balance, others use provision to mean the balance in an account balance.", "Definition of Product Costs": "Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.", "Examples of Product Costs": "The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.", "Definition of Period Costs": "Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.", "Example of Period Costs": "Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire.\u00a0(However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)", "Definition of Double Entry": "In accounting, double entry means that every transaction will involve at least two accounts.  Double entry also requires that one account be debited and the other account be credited. Accounting software might record the effect on one account automatically and only require information on the other account. ", "Examples of Double Entry": "When a company borrows money from a bank, the company\u2019s asset Cash is increased and the company\u2019s liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable is increased. When a company pays a six-month insurance premium, the company\u2019s asset Cash is decreased and its asset Prepaid Insurance is increased. Each month, one-sixth of the premium is recorded as Insurance Expense and the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced. When an employee works for hourly wages, the company\u2019s account Wages Expense is increased and its liability account Wages Payable is increased. When the employee is paid, the account Wages Payable is decreased and Cash is decreased. When a company\u2019s software prepares a check, the software will automatically reduce the Cash account. Therefore, the company needs to indicate the other account (such as Accounts Payable, an expense, etc.).", "Definition of Stockholder and Shareholder": "The term stockholder or shareholder typically describes an investor who own shares of a corporation\u2019s common stock. An owner of a corporation\u2019s preferred stock is usually referred to as a preferred stockholder or preferred shareholder. Stockholders may receive dividends based on the number of shares of stock they own. Stockholders also hope to see the market value of their shares of stock increase. In short, there is no difference between a stockholder and a shareholder. ", "Definition of Sole Proprietorship": "A sole proprietorship is a form of business organization that is owned by one person and is easy to start. The owner is referred to as a sole proprietor. It is important to note that a sole proprietorship is not legally separate from its owner (as would be the case with a corporation). However, the sole proprietor may be able to register as a limited liability company in order to limit his or her personal liability. You should seek professional advice as to the appropriate form of business for your situation and location. In addition, your state government will likely have an office to assist in starting a new business.", "Accounting for Sole Proprietorships": "In accounting, the balance sheet of the sole proprietorship reflects the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity. Owner\u2019s equity consists of the owner\u2019s capital account and a drawing account. The drawing account is a temporary account in which the owner\u2019s current year draws or withdrawals are recorded. The sole proprietor withdraws money for personal use because he or she is not paid a salary or wages. As a result, the income statement for the sole proprietorship business does not include an expense for the owner working in the business. This means that the reported net income is the total return for the owner\u2019s work and investment.", "Definition of Statement of Cash Flows": "The statement of cash flows (SCF) is one of the required external financial statements. The SCF is commonly referred to as the cash flow statement. The statement of cash flows presents the following information:", "Example of Statement of Cash Flows": "You can see an example of an SCF by searching the internet for any corporation whose stock is publicly traded. You will see that the SCF shows the corporation\u2019s cash inflows without parentheses, and the cash outflows are shown in parentheses. The major cash flows are arranged in the financial statement as follows:", "Definition of Inventory Accuracy": "Inventory accuracy means the following:", "Example of Importance of Accurate Inventory": "Here is an example of why accuracy in calculating inventory is important. After accounting for the total cost of 1) the items purchased or produced in the current period, plus 2) the costs of items carried over from the previous period, must be divided up as follows:", "Definition of Gross Sales": "Gross sales are the amounts a company earned from selling its products. The amounts originate from the company\u2019s sales invoices but the total will be adjusted to the accrual basis at the end of each accounting period.", "Example of Gross Sales": "A company\u2019s original sales invoice amounts are the source for the company\u2019s gross sales. These amounts are recorded as credit entries in the general ledger account Sales. Any sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts should be recorded as debit entries in separate contra revenue accounts to inform management of their magnitude. Therefore, gross sales can also be defined as the company\u2019s sales revenues before deducting the sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. (The amount remaining after these deductions is known as net sales.) The income statements of publicly-traded corporations typically begin with net sales or net revenues.", "What is Separation of Duties": "The separation of duties is one of various internal control techniques for safeguarding a company\u2019s assets. By separating employee\u2019s duties, the likelihood of theft, embezzlement, etc. is reduced. The reason is it will now require two dishonest people working together to admit to each other that they are dishonest and then plan and carry out the crime.", "Example of Separation of Duties": "A bank requires that its night depository safe be opened twice a day and the deposits processed immediately. Rather than have one person opening and emptying the safe, the bank requires that an officer and another employee open the safe and take the deposits to a third person (bank teller) who processes the deposits. Further, the bank sends or makes available bank statements showing all of the customer\u2019s deposits and other transactions. Having the duties separated, it is difficult to hide a theft for an extended time.", "Definition of How and When to Depreciate an Asset": "Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost (minus any salvage value), whichever comes first. The amount of depreciation over the asset\u2019s useful life is the asset\u2019s cost minus an estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life. The result of this calculation is sometimes referred to as the asset\u2019s depreciable cost.  For a company\u2019s financial statements the asset\u2019s depreciable cost (based on the estimated salvage value) is divided by the estimated years of useful life to arrive at a consistent annual amount to be debited to Depreciation Expense and is credited to Accumulated Depreciation. This method is know as the straight-line depreciation. For U.S. income taxes the Internal Revenue Service has specified the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows a company\u2019s tax return to deduct larger amounts of depreciation in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets\u2019 lives. This accelerated depreciation can be used on the tax returns at the same time that straight-line depreciation is used on the company\u2019s financial statements.", "Example of How and When to Depreciate an Asset": "Assume that a U.S. corporation purchases new equipment at a cost of $700,000 and expects the equipment to have $0 salvage value at the end of its 10-year useful life. The company\u2019s annual depreciation for a full accounting year will be $70,000 ($700,000 \u2013 $0 salvage value = $700,000/10 years = $70,000). The depreciation begins when the asset is put into service. For income tax purposes the depreciation depends on the tax regulations in the year that the asset is put into service. It is possible there is some \u201cbonus\u201d depreciation, a required 7-year life, an accelerated method assumed, etc. These tax regulations affect when the total amount of $700,000 in depreciation is taken. In other words, the total amount of depreciation over the life of the asset is $700,000 on the financial statements and on the tax return. The difference is when the $700,000 is reported as depreciation expense. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.", "Definition of Contributed Capital": "Contributed capital is one of the major components of a corporation\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity. Contributed capital is often described as paid-in capital and as corporation\u2019s permanent capital. Typically, a corporation issues shares of its  common stock and receives cash for the stock\u2019s fair market value. The transaction will be recorded with a debit to the Cash account and a credit to one or two contributed capital accounts such as Common Stock (and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Value). If the corporation exchanges some of its shares of common stock for property, the fair market value of the stock or the property (whichever is more clear) is debited to the property account and credited to one or two contributed capital accounts.  Note that both the corporation\u2019s assets increased and its stockholders\u2019 equity (specifically the contributed capital) increased.", "Example of Contributed Capital": "Assume a corporation issued and sold 10,000 new shares of its common stock for $900,000. The money received by the corporation is debited to the current asset Cash and $900,000 is credited to a contributed capital account such as Common Stock. Assume that two days later the corporation purchases real estate consisting of land and a warehouse/office building for $700,000. Assume that the land is appraised to be 1/7 of the real estate cost. After the real estate purchase, the corporation\u2019s general ledger accounts will have a debit balance of $200,000 in the current asset account Cash, a debit balance of $100,000 in the noncurrent asset account Land, a debit balance of $600,000 in the noncurrent asset account Warehouse/Office Building, and a $900,000 credit balance in the contributed capital account Common Stock. After several accounting periods, the amounts in the asset accounts will change from the depreciation of the building and from hundreds of other transactions. However, the amount in the Common Stock account will normally remain at $900,000.", "Definition of Turnover": "In accounting, the term turnover can have more than one meaning. In some countries turnover is used in place of sales. Turnover also pertains to certain financial ratios that relate a balance sheet (average) amount to an income statement amount.  Outside of accounting, turnover is used to express the rate at which a company has to replace the employees who leave the company.", "Examples of Turnover in Financial Ratios": "The following are a few of the most common financial ratios in which a turnover is computed:", "Try our free Quizzes": "Work our free accounting Quizzes for the topics covered in your course.

In the process, you may be helping your instructor become more empathetic and in the process help future students as well.", "Definition of Sale of a Plant Asset": "The sale of a plant asset is often the disposal of a company\u2019s equipment (or other asset) that had been used in the company\u2019s business operations.  When a plant asset is sold, the following steps must be reflected in the company\u2019s general ledger accounts:", "Example of a Sale of a Plant Asset": "Assume that Company XYZ wants to dispose of some production equipment that had a cost of $210,000 several years ago. As of the time of the disposal, the equipment\u2019s accumulated depreciation is $195,000. ABC Company is willing to remove the equipment and pay XYZ $10,000. Since XYZ is not in the business of buying and selling equipment, this sale of equipment is a \u201cperipheral\u201d activity and is not reported as part of its sales revenue. Instead, XYZ remove\u2019s the equipment\u2019s cost of $210,000 and the related accumulated depreciation of $195,000. Therefore, the book value of $15,000 is being removed from the general ledger accounts and cash of $10,000 is being added. This $5,000 loss (cash received of $10,000 minus book value of $15,000) is reported on the income statement as a separate item. Often this loss appears in the income statement section entitled Other or Nonoperating.  The $10,000 of proceeds from the sale of the plant asset is also reported as a positive amount in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.", "Definition of Recording a Yearly Subscription": "Typically, yearly subscriptions are paid in advance or at the start of the subscription period. If the amount of a company\u2019s subscription is insignificant, the company will debit Subscription Expense and will credit Cash (or Accounts Payable).  If the amount of the subscription is significant, the company should debit the cost of the subscription to the current asset account Prepaid Expenses and credit Cash. During the period of the subscription, the company credits Prepaid Expenses and debits Subscription Expense for the amount that is expiring.", "Example of Recording a Yearly Subscription": "Assume that a company pays $1,200 on March 20 for a one-year subscription for a business newsletter that will begin on April 1. Also assume the company issues monthly financial statements and that the $1,200 cost is considered to be significant. On March 20, the company debits Prepaid Expenses for $1,200 and credits Cash for $1,200. At the end of each month (starting on April 30), the company will record a deferral adjusting entry to debit Subscription Expense for $100 and credit Prepaid Expenses for $100. The 12 monthly adjusting entries will:", "Definition of Chart of Accounts": "The chart of accounts is a listing of the names and account numbers for the general ledger accounts available for recording amounts. However, the chart of accounts will not include any transaction amounts or account balances. The chart of accounts is helpful for identifying the accounts to be used when encountering less frequent transactions. The chart of accounts and the general ledger accounts can also be modified to provide more detailed information, reflect changes in the business operations, etc.", "Examples of Chart of Accounts": "The chart of accounts is likely arranged in the same order as the general ledger. That is, the balance sheet accounts are listed first, followed by the income statement accounts.  A large corporation\u2019s chart of accounts could consist of thousands of accounts each with an account number (perhaps with more than 10 digits) and an account title. The chart of accounts for a very small company might consist of less than one hundred accounts with an account number having 3 digits. The first digit of a six-digit account number will likely indicate the type of account. For instance, an asset account number will begin with the digit \u201c1\u201d. Liability accounts will begin with the digit \u201c2\u201d. Operating revenue accounts will begin with the digit \u201c3\u201d, etc. Operating expenses will use accounts beginning with digits such as \u201c4\u201d through \u201c7\u201d. Nonoperating revenues, nonoperating expenses, gains, losses, and other items might begin with \u201c9\u201d. At a large company, the second digit of the account numbers might indicate the division within the company, while the third digit will indicate a department within the division. The remaining digits of the account numbers will indicate the type of revenue, type of expense, etc. Popular accounting software will include some examples of charts of accounts. Our Explanation of Chart of Accounts includes two hypothetical examples.", "Definition of Depreciation Methods": "There are various methods of depreciating assets that are used in a business. It is acceptable and common for companies to use two or more of the methods of depreciation.", "Examples of Using Two Methods of Depreciation": "It is very common for a company to depreciate its plant assets by using straight-line depreciation on its financial statements, while using an accelerated method of depreciation on its income tax return. A company could also be depreciating its equipment by using a useful life of 10 years for its financial statements, while using a useful life of 7 years for its income tax return. Even the depreciation for a company\u2019s\u00a0financial statements could consist of some assets being depreciated using the units of production or units of activity method, while other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method.", "Definition of a Fully Depreciated Asset": "A fully depreciated asset is one that has accumulated depreciation equal to its cost. Hence, the book value of the asset is $0. Once an asset is fully depreciated, there will be no additional depreciation expense.", "Example of a Fully Depreciated Asset": "Let\u2019s assume that a company purchased a building more than 30 years ago at a cost of $600,000. The company then depreciated the building at a rate of $20,000 per year for 30 years. Today the building continues to be used by the company and it plans to continue using it for many more years. The company\u2019s current balance sheet will report the building at its cost of $600,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $600,000 (a book value of $0) even if the building\u2019s current market value is $2,000,000. Unless there are improvements to the building, there will be no depreciation expense after the 30th year.", "Definition of Inventory Error": "An inventory error could be the result of any of the following:", "Example of an Inventory Error": "Assume that a company began operations on December 1. During December the company purchased $100,000 of goods that it planned to sell to customers. The company\u2019s December 31 ending inventory was calculated to be $15,000. As a result, its balance sheet will report inventory of $15,000 and its income statement will report cost of goods sold of $85,000 ($100,000 \u2013 $15,000). During January the company purchased $130,000 of goods and had $20,000 in inventory at the end of January 31. Therefore, January\u2019s cost of goods sold will be $125,000\u00a0(beginning inventory of $15,000 plus purchases of $130,000 minus ending inventory of $20,000). Now let\u2019s assume that only one error occurred and it involved the calculation of the December 31 ending inventory. Instead of the $15,000 which was reported, the true amount of inventory was $19,000. That meant the December 31 balance sheet understated the true cost of inventory by $4,000. It also meant that December\u2019s income statement  cost of goods sold was not the reported $85,000. Rather, the true cost of goods sold was $81,000 ($100,000 minus $19,000 of inventory). In January, the true cost of goods sold is $129,000 (beginning inventory of $19,000 plus the purchases of $130,000 minus the January 31 inventory of $20,000) not the $125,000 that had been reported.", "Definition of Natural Business Year": "A natural business year is the period of 12 consecutive months (or 52-53 consecutive weeks) ending at a low point of the organization\u2019s activities for the year.", "Examples of a Natural Business Year": "The natural business year for a school year is July 1 through June 30. The reason is that school year classes are usually finished in June. A retailer\u2019s natural business year might be the 52-53 consecutive weeks ending on the Saturday closest to each February 1. This is a low point of activity for the retailer since its holiday season is finished, the merchandise returns from holiday sales are completed, and the January clearance sales have taken place. [The 52-53 week periods with 13-week quarters allows for better comparisons than calendar months.] Many companies have a natural business year of January 1 through December 31. On the other hand, some companies are required by government regulations to end their accounting years on December 31, even though it is not the end of their natural business year. The term fiscal year is associated with companies having financial reporting years that do not end on December 31.", "Definition of Net Sales": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, net sales is the total amount of goods shipped/delivered to customers during a specified period of time minus any early payment discounts (if offered by the seller) and minus allowances for goods returned by customers, adjustments to the sales invoice amounts, etc.", "Example of Net Sales": "Assume that in the most recent month, a retailer had $220,000 of merchandise sales. It also allowed customers $2,000 in early payment discounts. Some customers were allowed to return goods that had been sold for $4,000 and a few customers were given sales allowances for $1,000. The retailer\u2019s net sales for the month were $213,000 ($220,000 \u2013 $2,000 \u2013 $4,000 \u2013 $1,000).", "Definition of Systematic and Rational Allocation": "Systematic and rational allocation is typically included in the definition of depreciation. In this context, it means that a company\u2019s annual depreciation expense reported on its financial statements should be based on a formula that is:", "Example of Systematic and Rational Allocation": "Assume that a retailer purchases new fixtures which are expected to have a useful life of 10 years with no salvage value. Therefore, if the retailer pays $120,000 for new fixtures, its income statements will report depreciation expense of $12,000 each year ($1,000 each month) for 10 years. Assume that another company purchases equipment for $20,000 that will be useful for producing a total of 20,000 items. If in the first year of operations the company produces 1,800 items, the depreciation expense will be $1,800. If in the second year the company produces 3,700 units, the depreciation expense will be $3,700. Both of these depreciation calculations are logical, consistently applied, and objective.", "Definition Bank Reconciliation": "The bank reconciliation (if prepared or reviewed by someone other than the person with access to the checking account) is a form of internal control over a company\u2019s checking account balance. Basically, the bank reconciliation compares the amounts in a company\u2019s accounting records with the amounts in its bank\u2019s records. Any differences are reconciled (explained) so that improper amounts will be exposed and the company\u2019s records and financial statements will report the correct balance for company\u2019s checking account. At a minimum, the bank reconciliation should be done within a few days after the end of each month. However, with the bank\u2019s electronic records readily accessible, the bank reconciliation should be done more frequently. ", "Examples for a Timely Bank Reconciliation": "Some reasons for preparing a bank reconciliation as soon as possible include the following:", "Definition of Certificate of Deposit": "A certificate of deposit, also referred to as a CD, is a time deposit at a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. A certificate of deposit requires that the money cannot be accessed until an agreed upon maturity date. However, if the depositor insists on withdrawing the money before the maturity date, the financial institution will assess a penalty\u2014usually the loss of interest. Since the depositor agreed to a maturity date, the certificate of deposit will pay a higher interest rate than is paid on a regular savings account or money market account. The length of a certificate of deposit will vary. It could be for one month, three months, six months, one year, 17 months, three years, etc. Generally the longer the time until maturity, the higher the interest rate. A CD that matures in less than one year will be reported by the bank as a current liability, and will be reported as a short-term investment by the depositor (provided the amount is not restricted by the depositor).", "Example of a Certificate of Deposit": "James Company has a seasonal business and wants to earn interest on its excess cash balance during the seven months between its busy seasons. Therefore, James Company purchased a six-month certificate of deposit for $100,000 from its local bank. The CD pays an annual rate of 1% compared to 0.4% of the bank\u2019s money market account, 0.1% on the bank\u2019s savings account, and 0% on the bank\u2019s checking account.", "Definition of Liabilities": "Liabilities are a company\u2019s obligations and are usually defined as a claim on the company\u2019s assets. However, liabilities (and stockholders\u2019 equity) can also be viewed as the\u00a0sources of the company\u2019s assets. The money raised by a company\u2019s liabilities will generally have a lower cost than money raised from stockholders\u2019 equity for the following reasons:", "Example of Liabilities": "Assume a corporation needs to replace its existing equipment with equipment that has the latest new technologies. The new equipment will result in better products at a lower cost. If the corporation is able to borrow the money needed at say 7% interest, the interest expense after the income tax benefit may be only 5%. If the cost savings from the new equipment does occur, the corporation\u2019s present owners will enjoy the increased earnings without a reduction in their ownership percentages. ", "Definition of Balance Sheet and Income Statement": "The balance sheet reflects the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s (Stockholders\u2019) Equity  When a company earns revenues by performing services for cash, its assets increase and its owner\u2019s equity increases. When the company pays cash for an advertisement expense, its assets decrease and its owner\u2019s equity decreases. In accounting and bookkeeping there is a separate financial statement known as the income statement that reports the revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that are recorded in income statement accounts. This allows the balance sheet account Owner\u2019s Capital (or Retained Earnings) to avoid having all of the thousands or millions of revenue and expense transactions from appearing. Instead, only the bottom line of the income statement, net income, needs to appear in the the owner\u2019s equity account.", "Example of the Connection Between the Balance Sheet and Income Statement": "Our Explanation of Accounting Equation contains a series of transactions to illustrate the connection between the income statement and the balance sheet for both a sole proprietorship and a corporation.", "Definition of Fixed Assets and Plant Assets": "My experience indicates that people use the term fixed assets to mean the same as plant assets. As a result, I define both fixed assets and plant assets to be noncurrent, long-lived, tangible assets used in a business. They are reported in the Property, Plant and Equipment section of the balance sheet. The fixed/plant assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives (except for land which is not depreciated).", "Examples of Fixed Assets and Plant Assets": "The following are examples of the non-current, tangible assets known as fixed assets and plant assets which are used within a business and are classified as property, plant and equipment:", "Definition of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles": "Generally accepted accounting principles (commonly referred to as GAAP or US GAAP) are the common accounting rules that must be followed when a U.S. company prepares financial statements that will be distributed to people outside of the company.  These common rules range from basic underlying principles and assumptions to the detailed rules established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for complex financial transactions. The FASB has organized the generally accepted accounting principles in its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).", "Why Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are Required?": "Generally accepted accounting principles are required so a knowledgeable reader of financial statements is able to do the following:", "Definition of Credit Sales": "As opposed to cash sales, credit sales (or sales on credit) allow the customer to pay the seller at a later date. Perhaps the seller allows its credit worthy customers to pay in 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, etc. At the time of the sale, the seller will debit Accounts Receivable and will credit Sales. When the seller receives payment from the customer, the seller will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.", "Example of a Credit Sale": "Assume that SellerCo delivers $5,000 of goods to a customer on December 30 and no further action is required by SellerCo. Under the accrual basis of accounting, SellerCo will report $5,000 in its income statement accounts Sales and will report $5,000 in its current asset account Accounts Receivable. Assume that on January 31, SellerCo receives $5,000 from the customer. On this date SellerCo debits Cash for $5,000 and credits Accounts Receivable for $5,000. ", "Definition of Double-Entry System": "The double-entry system of accounting or bookkeeping means that for every business transaction, amounts must be recorded in a minimum of two accounts. The double-entry system also requires that for all transactions, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits.", "Example of a Double-Entry System": "To illustrate double entry, let\u2019s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company\u2019s Cash account must be increased by $10,000 and a liability account must be increased by $10,000. To increase an asset, a debit entry is required. To increase a liability, a credit entry is required. Hence, the account Cash will be debited for $10,000 and the liability Loans Payable will be credited for $10,000.", "Double Entry Keeps the Accounting Equation in Balance": "Double entry also means that the accounting equation (assets = liabilities + owner\u2019s equity) will always be in balance. In our example, the accounting equation remained in balance because both assets and liabilities were each increased by $10,000.", "Definition of a Trial Balance": "A trial balance is a bookkeeping or accounting report that lists the balances in each of an organization\u2019s general ledger accounts. (Often the accounts with zero balances will not be listed.) The debit balance amounts are listed in a column with the heading \u201cDebit balances\u201d and the credit balance amounts are listed in another column with the heading \u201cCredit balances.\u201d The total of each of these two columns should be identical.", "Examples of the Trial Balance\u2019s Use": "The trial balance is not a financial statement. It is mainly an internal report that is/was useful in a manual accounting system. If the trial balance did not \u201cbalance\u201d it signaled an error somewhere between the journal and the trial balance. Often the cause of the difference was a miscalculation of an account balance, posting a debit amount as a credit (or vice versa), transposing digits within an amount when posting or preparing the trial balance, etc. Today\u2019s accounting software has been written to eliminate those errors. Hence, the trial balance is less important for bookkeeping purposes since it is almost certain that the general ledger and the trial balance will have the debits equal to the credits. The trial balance continues to be useful for auditors and accountants who wish to show 1) the general ledger account balances prior to their proposed adjustments, 2) their proposed adjustments, and 3) all of the account balances after the proposed adjustments. The adjusted amounts make up the adjusted trial balance, and the adjusted amounts will be used in the organization\u2019s financial statements.", "Definition of a Journal Entry": "In manual accounting or bookkeeping systems, business transactions are first recorded in a journal\u2026hence the term journal entry. Journal entries that are recorded in a company\u2019s general journal will consist of the following:", "Examples of Journal Entries": "Even with computerized accounting systems some general journal entries are necessary. Common general journal entries are the adjusting entries. For example, prior to issuing the company\u2019s financial statements there will be an adjusting entry to record depreciation. This journal entry will debit Depreciation Expense and will credit Accumulated Depreciation. Another example of a general journal entry is the adjusting entry to accrue interest on a bank loan. This journal entry will debit Interest Expense and will credit Interest Payable.", "Definition of an Accrual": "An accrual pertains to:", "Example of an Expense Accrual": "The accrual of an expense or an expense accrual refers to the reporting of an expense and the related liability in an accounting period that is prior to the period when the amount will be paid or the vendor\u2019s invoice will be processed. An example of an expense accrual is the electricity that is used in December where neither the bill nor the payment will be processed until January. The December electricity should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Electricity Expense and credits a liability account such as Accrued Expenses Payable.", "Example of a Revenue Accrual": "The accrual of revenues or a revenue accrual refers to the reporting of revenue and the related asset in the period in which they are earned, and which is prior to processing a sales invoice or receiving the money. An example of the accrual of revenues is a bond investment\u2019s interest that is earned in December but the money will not be received until a later accounting period. This interest should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Receivable and credits Interest Income.", "Definition of a Deferral": "A deferral occurs when a company has:", "Example of an Expense Deferral": "A deferral of an expense or an expense deferral involves a payment that was paid in advance of the accounting period(s) in which it will become an expense. An example is a payment made in December for property insurance covering the next six months of January through June. The amount that is not yet expired should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. The amount that expires in an accounting period should be reported as Insurance Expense.", "Example of a Revenue Deferral": "A deferral of revenues or a revenue deferral involves money that was received in advance of earning it. An example is the insurance company receiving money in December for providing insurance protection for the next six months. Until the money is earned, the insurance company should report the unearned amount as a current liability such as Unearned Insurance Premiums. As the insurance premiums are earned, they should be reported on the income statement as Insurance Premium Revenues.", "Defining the Entries When Selling a Fixed Asset": "When a fixed asset or plant asset is sold, there are several things that must take place:", "Definition of Suspense Account": "A suspense account is a general ledger account in which amounts are temporarily recorded.  The suspense account is used because the appropriate general ledger account could not be determined at the time that the transaction was recorded. As soon as possible, the amount(s) in the suspense account should be moved to the proper account(s).", "Example of Using a Suspense Account": "An accountant was instructed to record a significant number of journal entries written by the controller of a large company. Unfortunately, there was one amount that did not have an account designated. In order to complete the assignment by the deadline, the accountant recorded the \u201cmystery\u201d amount in the general ledger Suspense account. When the controller is available, the accountant will get clarification and will move the amount from the Suspense account to the appropriate account.", "Definition of Miscellaneous Expense": "In accounting, miscellaneous expense may refer to a general ledger account in which small, infrequent transaction amounts are recorded. The account Miscellaneous Expenses should be used as the last resort. For example, the small bank fees would be better recorded in a separate account such as Bank Service Charges instead of recording them in Miscellaneous Expenses. Miscellaneous expense may also be the description on a company\u2019s income statement that refers to the amount consisting of small balances contained in many general ledger expense accounts.", "Definition of Reversing Entries": "Reversing entries are made on the first day of an accounting period to remove accrual adjusting entries that were made at the end of the previous accounting period. Two benefits of using reversing entries are:", "Example of Reversing Entries": "To illustrate reversing entries, let\u2019s assume that a retailer uses a temporary employment agency service to provide workers from December 15 to December 29. The temp agency will bill the retailer on January 6 and the retailer is required to pay the invoice by January 10. Assuming the retailer\u2019s accounting year ends on December 31, the retailer will make an accrual adjusting entry on December 31 for the estimated amount. If the estimated amount is $18,000 the retailer will debit Temp Service Expense for $18,000 and will credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000. This adjusting entry assures that the retailer\u2019s income statement for the period ended December 31 will report the $18,000 expense and its balance sheet as of December 31 will report the $18,000 liability. After the financial statements are prepared, the closing entries will transfer the balance in the account Temp Service Expense to an owner\u2019s/stockholders\u2019 equity account. As a result, the account Temp Service Expense will begin January with a zero balance.   When a reversing entry is recorded as of January 1, it simply removes the estimated amounts contained in the December 31 accrual adjusting entry. In other words, the January 1 reversing entry will:", "Examples of Accounts with Debit Balances": "The following general ledger account classifications normally have debit balances:", "Definition of Advance to an Employee": "A cash advance to an employee is usually a temporary loan by a company to an employee. In other words, the company is the lender and the employee is the borrower. The cash advance needs to be reported as a reduction in the company\u2019s Cash account and an increase in an asset account such as Advance to Employees or Other Receivables: Advances. (If the amount is expected to be repaid within one year, this account will be reported as a current asset.) If the cash advance is repaid through payroll withholdings, the routine payroll entry will record the amount withheld as a credit to Advance to Employees. This in turn results in a smaller amount being credited to Net Payroll Payable.", "Example of Advance to an Employee": "Let\u2019s assume that a valuable employee\u2019s car requires an emergency repair of $800. The employee is unable to pay for the repair and has no other means for getting to work. The company agrees to lend the employee $800 and to withhold $100 per week from the employee\u2019s weekly payroll checks until the $800 is repaid. The company will debit the current asset Advance to Employees for $800 and will credit Cash for $800. The weekly payroll processing will result in a credit of $100 to Advance to Employees (thereby reducing by $100 the amount credited to Net Payroll Payable).", "Definition of Drawing Account": "A sole proprietorship will have a drawing account in which the owner\u2019s withdrawals or draws of cash or other assets are recorded. The amounts of the owner\u2019s draws are recorded with a debit to the drawing account and a credit to cash or other asset. At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed by transferring the debit balance to the owner\u2019s capital account.", "The Drawing Account is a Capital Account": "To answer your question, the drawing account is a capital account. It\u2019s debit balance will reduce the owner\u2019s capital account balance and the owner\u2019s equity. The drawing account\u2019s purpose is to report separately the owner\u2019s draws during each accounting year. Since the capital account and owner\u2019s equity accounts are expected to have credit balances, the drawing account (having a debit balance) is considered to be a contra account. In addition, the drawing account is a temporary account since its balance is closed to the capital account at the end of each accounting year. ", "Example of the Drawing Account": "Let\u2019s assume that L. Ott begins a sole proprietorship with a cash investment of $3,000. The journal entry will debit Cash for $3,000 and will credit L. Ott, Capital for $3,000. Later, the L. Ott withdraws $500 from the business for her personal use. The journal entry for this transaction will debit L. Ott, Drawing for $500 and will credit Cash for $500. After this transaction, the business will have assets of $2,500 and will have owner\u2019s equity of $2,500.  ", "Definition of Contra Account": "A contra account is a general ledger account with an account balance that is the opposite of the normal balance for that account classification. For example, Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account that is associated with asset accounts for buildings, equipment, vehicles, etc. The asset accounts have debit balances, but the related account Accumulated Depreciation will have a credit balance. ", "Examples of Contra Accounts": "To illustrate, let\u2019s use the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Since it is a contra asset account, this allowance account must have a credit balance (which is contrary to the debit balances found in asset accounts). The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is directly related to the asset account entitled Accounts Receivable. Therefore, if the Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $40,000 and the allowance account has a credit balance of $2,000, the readers of the balance sheet will see that customers owe $40,000 for past purchases but the company does not expect to collect $2,000 of the $40,000. Therefore, the net amount of the accounts receivable that is expected to turn to cash is $38,000. A second example of a contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. For instance, if a company has a plant asset such as Equipment with a debit balance of $92,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $50,000, the carrying amount (or book value) of the equipment is $42,000. The income statement account Sales Returns and Allowances is a contra revenue account that is associated with the revenue account Sales. If the balance in this contra account is a debit of $3,000 and the Sales account has the expected credit balance of $400,000, the company\u2019s net sales are $397,000. This use of Sales Returns and Allowances (instead of debiting Sales) enables management to see that its customers had a problem with $3,000 of the company\u2019s goods.", "Definition of Dividends Account": "When a corporation declares a cash dividend, the amount declared will reduce the amount of the corporation\u2019s retained earnings. Instead of debiting the Retained Earnings account at the time the dividend is declared, a corporation could instead debit a related account entitled Dividends (or Cash Dividends Declared). However, at the end of the accounting year, the balance in the Dividends account will be closed by transferring its balance to the Retained Earnings account. When interim financial statements are issued, the amount reported for the corporation\u2019s retained earnings will be the combination of the credit balance in the Retained Earnings account and the debit balance in the Dividends account.  Both the Dividends account and the Retained Earnings account are part of stockholders\u2019 equity. They are somewhat similar to the sole proprietor\u2019s Drawing account and Capital account which are part of owner\u2019s equity. Both the Dividends account and the Drawing account are temporary balance sheet accounts since they are closed at the end of each year in order for the accounts to begin the following year with $0 balances.", "Example of Using the Dividends Account": "Assume a corporation declares a cash dividend of $50,000 on its common stock.\nOn the date the dividend is declared, the corporation will credit the current liability account Dividends Payable for $50,000 and will debit either one of the following accounts for $50,000:", "Definition of an Accounts Payable Credit": "Since Accounts Payable is a liability account, it should have a credit balance. The credit balance indicates the amount that a company or organization owes to its suppliers or vendors. If a company purchases additional goods or services on credit (as opposed to paying with cash), the company will need to credit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance will increase accordingly.", "Definition of an Accounts Payable Debit": "If a company pays one of its suppliers the amount that is included in Accounts Payable, the company will need to debit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance is decreased.", "Definition of Real Account": "The balance in a real account is not closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a real account begins each accounting year with its balance from the end of the previous year. Because the end-of-the-year balance is carried forward to the next accounting year, a real account is also known as a permanent account.", "Examples of Real Accounts": "The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts such as the accounts for recording assets, liabilities, and the owner\u2019s (or stockholders\u2019) equity. However, the sole proprietor\u2019s drawing account, which is reported on the balance sheet during the year, is a temporary account because it is closed directly to the owner\u2019s capital account at the end of the year.", "Why Expenses Are Debited": "Expenses cause owner\u2019s equity to decrease. Since owner\u2019s equity\u2019s normal balance is a credit balance, an expense must be recorded as a debit. At the end of the accounting year the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner\u2019s capital account, thereby reducing owner\u2019s equity. (At a corporation, the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders\u2019 equity account.)", "Example of Why Expenses Are Debited": "To illustrate why expenses are debited, let\u2019s assume that a new company has only one asset, Cash of $10,000, and its owner\u2019s equity is $10,000. The company then pays $500 for advertising that occurs at the time of payment. The company must reduce its Cash (which has a debit balance of $10,000) by entering a credit of $500. To comply with double-entry accounting, the company must record a debit of $500, which will be entered in Advertising Expense. Let\u2019s also assume this was the only transaction for the year. As a result, the company\u2019s balance sheet will report assets of $9,500 and owner\u2019s equity of $9,500. As you can see, there are two reasons why Advertising Expense had to be debited:", "Definition of a Real Account": "A real account is a general ledger account that does not close at the end of the accounting year. In other words, the balances in the real accounts are carried over to become the beginning balances of the next accounting period. Real accounts are also referred to as permanent accounts.", "Definition of Sundry Expenses": "In accounting and bookkeeping, sundry expenses are expenses that are small in amount and rare in occurrence. For these rare and insignificant expenses, a company might use a general ledger account entitled Sundry Expenses for these items. If any of the items recorded in Sundry Expenses begin to occur frequently and/or become significant, a new account should be opened for such items. Sundry expenses could also refer to a line on a company\u2019s income statement. Such a line will likely include the combined total of several expense accounts that have small balances. Today, we are likely to use the description Miscellaneous Expenses for these items.", "Definition of Supplies": "Office supplies are items used to carry out tasks in a company\u2019s departments outside of manufacturing or shipping. Office supplies are likely to include paper, printer cartridges, pens, etc.  Shipping supplies are the cartons, tape, shrink wrap, etc. for preparing products that are being shipped to customers. Manufacturing supplies are items used in the manufacturing facilities, but are not a direct material for the products manufactured. These will include a wide variety of items from cleaning supplies to machine lubricants.", "Accounting for Office Supplies": "The cost of office supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period should be the balance in a current asset account such as Supplies or Supplies on Hand. The cost of the office supplies used up during the accounting period should be recorded in the income statement account Supplies Expense. When supplies are purchased, the amount will be debited to Supplies. At the end of the accounting period, the balance in the account Supplies will be adjusted to be the amount on hand, and the amount of the adjustment will be recorded in Supplies Expense. (If the amount of supplies on hand is insignificant, a company may simply debit Supplies Expense when the supplies are purchased.)

Assume that the company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash reports an imprest balance of $100. Let\u2019s now assume that when the petty cash fund is replenished, there is $6.00 on hand and there are $93.00 of petty cash vouchers. This indicates a shortage of $1.00. Using the above information, the journal entry to replenish the petty cash fund will include a credit of $94.00 to the account Cash: Checking Account. (This is the amount of the company check that will be cashed to get the cash in the petty cash fund back to the imprest general ledger amount of $100.) The debits will be the accounts and amounts shown on the petty cash receipts, which total $93.

", "Example of Adjusting the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts": "The balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts should be the estimated amount of the company\u2019s receivables that will not be turning to cash. For example, if the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts presently has a credit balance of $2,000 and you believe there is a total of $2,900 in Accounts Receivable that will not be collected, you need to enter an additional credit amount of $900 into the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The other part of this adjusting entry will be a debit of $900 to Bad Debts Expense. Note that some authors and companies may refer to the allowance account as Allowance for Uncollectible Expense, Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts. The related income statement account could have the title of Uncollectible Accounts Expense, Doubtful Accounts Expense, etc.", "Definition of Short Term Bank Loan": "When a company borrows money from its bank and agrees to repay the loan amount within a year, the company will record the loan by increasing its cash and increasing a current liability such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable. The bank will record the loan by increasing a current asset such as Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable and increasing a current liability such as Customer Demand Deposits.", "Example of a Company Recording a Loan from a Bank": "Let\u2019s assume that a company obtains a $30,000 bank loan that must be repaid within 9 months. The bank deposits the loan proceeds of $30,000 into the company\u2019s checking account at the same bank. The double entry to be recorded by the company is: 1) a debit of $30,000 to the company\u2019s current asset account Cash for the amount that the bank deposited into the company\u2019s checking account, and 2) a credit of $30,000 to the company\u2019s current liability account Notes Payable (or Loans Payable) for the amount of principal that it must repay to the bank. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)", "Example of a Bank Recording a Loan to a Customer": "The double entry to be recorded by the bank is: 1) a debit to the bank\u2019s current asset account Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable for the principal amount it expects to collect, and 2) a credit to the bank\u2019s current liability account Customer Demand Deposits. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)", "Why Revenues are Credited": "Revenues cause owner\u2019s equity to increase. Since the normal balance for owner\u2019s equity is a credit balance, revenues must be recorded as a credit. At the end of the accounting year, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner\u2019s capital account, thereby increasing owner\u2019s equity. (At a corporation, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders\u2019 equity account.) It may be helpful to think of the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity, to understand why an asset (shown on the left side of the accounting equation) will normally have its account balance on the left side or debit side. Liabilities and owner\u2019s equity accounts (shown on the right side of the accounting equation) will normally have their account balances on the right side or credit side.", "Example of Why Revenues are Credited": "To illustrate why revenues are credited, let\u2019s assume that a company receives $900 at the time that it provides a service and therefore is earning the $900. The increase in the company\u2019s assets will be recorded with a debit of $900 to Cash. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, a credit of $900 will be recorded in the account Service Revenues. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that owner\u2019s equity will be increasing. If the company earns an additional $500 of revenue but allows the customer to pay in 30 days, the company will increase its asset account Accounts Receivable with a debit of $500. It must also record a credit of $500 in Service Revenues because the revenue was earned. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that the owner\u2019s equity will be increasing.", "Definition of Income Summary Account": "The Income Summary account is a temporary account used with closing entries in a manual accounting system. (Computerized accounting systems may close the temporary accounts without recording the amounts in an Income Summary account.) The Income Summary is very temporary since it has a zero balance throughout the year until the year-end closing entries are made. Next, the balance resulting from the closing entries will be moved to Retained Earnings (if a corporation) or the owner\u2019s capital account (if a sole proprietorship).", "Example of Income Summary Account": "In a manual accounting system, the closing entries will result in the following amounts in Income Summary:", "Entries To Record a Sale of Equipment": "When equipment that is used in a business is disposed of (sold) for cash before it is fully depreciated, two steps must be taken:", "Examples of Debit Balances": "A debit balance is normal and expected for the following accounts:", "Definition of Loan to Employee": "A loan to an employee is money advanced by the company to assist the employee. If the employee is expected to repay the loan within one year of the balance sheet date, the loan balance is a current asset of the company. Any amount not expected to be collected within one year is a noncurrent or long term asset. It is common for the loan to an employee to specify an interest rate and a schedule of payments.", "Entry to Record a Loan to Employee": "Assume that a company lends an employee $5,000 for a family emergency. The entry will debit Loan to Employee for $5,000 and will credit Cash for $5,000. Under the accrual method of accounting, at each balance sheet date the company should record any accrued interest  by debiting Interest Receivable and crediting Interest Income. When the employee makes a payment, the company will debit Cash and will credit Interest Receivable and Loan to Employee for the appropriate amounts. ", "Definition of Bill Payable": "A bill payable is a document which shows the amount owed for goods or services received on credit (meaning not paid at the time that the goods or services were received). The provider of the goods or services is referred to as the supplier or vendor.

(The debit will likely be recorded as an expense or asset.) When the bill is paid, Accounts Payable will be reduced with a debit entry, and Cash will be decreased with a credit entry. The credit balance in Accounts Payable is reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet as a current liability.", "Definition of an Adjusted Trial Balance": "The adjusted trial balance is an internal document that lists the general ledger account titles and their balances after any adjustments have been made. The adjusted trial balance is not a financial statement, but the adjusted account balances will be reported on the financial statements. The adjusted trial balance (as well as the unadjusted trial balance) must have the total amount of the debit balances equal to the total amount of credit balances.", "Examples of Adjusted Trial Balances": "In a manual accounting system, an unadjusted trial balance might be prepared by a bookkeeper to be certain that the general ledger has debit amounts equal to the credit amounts. After that is the case, the unadjusted trial balance is used by an accountant to indicate the necessary adjusting entries and the resulting adjusted balances. The adjusted balances are summed to become the adjusted trial balance.  An adjusted trial balance can also refer to a trial balance where the account balances are adjusted by the external auditors. The adjusted balances become the adjusted trial balance.

In a double-entry accounting system, if the balance in the account Prepaid Insurance is overstated (too much is being reported) it is likely that the account Insurance Expense is understated (too little is being reported).", "Definition of Credit Card Payments": "We define a credit card payment as the amount a company remits to the credit card company for the purchases that occurred by using the credit card. The company\u2019s payment to the credit card company will result in a credit to the company\u2019s Cash account. However, the debit portion of the payment entry depends on whether the individual credit card purchases had been previously recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger accounts.", "Example of Recording Credit Card Payments": "Assuming that the credit card purchases had not been previously entered into the accounts, there will be many debits in order to record each of the many credit card purchases/transactions into the company\u2019s appropriate general ledger account(s). Assuming that the credit card purchases were recorded in the general ledger accounts prior to the company paying\u00a0the credit card bill, the payment to the credit card company might be recorded with a credit to Cash and a single debit to Credit Card Payable (if that account was used when recording the credit card purchases).", "Definition of a Ledger": "A ledger is often defined as a book of accounts. Today the ledger and its accounts are likely to be an electronic record or file.", "Example of a Ledger": "An example of a ledger is a company\u2019s general ledger, which contains all of its asset, liability, owner equity, revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts.

I begin by drawing two T-accounts, marking one as the balance sheet account, and one as the income statement account. I then enter the current balances. The next step is to determine the amount that should be the correct ending balance for the balance sheet account. The difference between the current balance and the needed ending balance is the amount for the adjusting entry. As a young accountant I had to determine the effect of a new FASB standard on my employer\u2019s financial statements. I reported on the impact on the company\u2019s expenses in great detail. I thought I was done until the controller drew two T-accounts on a piece of paper and noted my comments in the expense T-account, and then asked, \u201cWhat about the other account?

Further, a computerized accounting system has eliminated the many math and clerical errors that had occurred with a manual accounting system. Of course, a trial balance that has the total debits equal to the total credits does not mean that the general ledger is free of errors. For instance, recording a debit entry into the Equipment account instead of recording the debit in the Equipment Repairs Account will not be uncovered by the trial balance.", "Reasons for Negative Current Liabilities on a Balance Sheet": "Some older accounting software used minus signs or parentheses to indicate credit balances, while positive numbers indicated debit balances. The accounting software usually had an option to print the liability account balances on the balance sheet without the negative signs. If only one liability account has a negative sign, it is likely that the liability account has a debit balance instead of the normal credit balance. This would be the case if a company remitted more than the amount needed.  During the first few days of the accounting period in which reversing entries are recorded to reverse the accrual adjusting entries for expenses and liabilities of the previous period, the current liability accounts will show debit balances.

In a double-entry accounting system, the amount in another account will also be understated by $20,000. If the $20,000 understatement is determined to be a misplaced invoice from a marketing consultant, the company\u2019s Marketing Consultants Expense will be the account that is understated by $20,000. As a result of the $20,000 understatement, the company\u2019s income statement will report too little of SG&A expenses, and too much net income.

The entry debits Depreciation Expense for $3,000 and credits Accumulated Depreciation for $3,000 each and every month.  A company may also have recurring journal entries in which the accounts are identical but the amounts vary each month. For example, the company\u2019s payroll entry will have the same accounts but different amounts due to the number of employees and/or the number of hours worked. Other examples of recurring entries with amounts that differ each period include sales, interest earned, interest expense, bank service charges, and others.", "Definition of Expenses Credited": "Normally, the general ledger accounts for expenses are debited and are expected to have debit balances. The reason they are debited is they cause the normal credit balance of stockholders\u2019 (owner\u2019s) equity to decrease. However, there are occasions when the general ledger expense accounts will be credited.", "Examples of Expenses being Credited": "Below are some examples of when general ledger expense accounts are credited:", "Definition of Double-Entry Bookkeeping": "Double-entry bookkeeping refers to the 500-year-old system in which each financial transaction of a company is recorded with an entry into at least two of its general ledger accounts. At least one account will have an amount entered as a debit and at least one account will have an amount entered as a credit. Further, the total amounts entered as debits must be equal to the total amounts entered as credits. Meeting these requirements will result in the accounting or bookkeeping equation being in balance at all times.", "Examples of Double-Entry Bookkeeping": "Let\u2019s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company\u2019s asset account Cash is increased with a debit entry of $10,000 and the company\u2019s liability account Loans Payable is increased with a credit entry of $10,000. If the company repays $3,000 of the amount borrowed, the company will decrease the amount in its Cash account with a credit entry of $3,000 and will reduce the balance in its Loan Payable account with a debit entry of $3,000. If the company pays its monthly rent of $2,000, a credit entry of $2,000 will be recorded in its Cash account and a $2,000 debit entry will be recorded in its Rent Expense account. If a company collects $500 from a customer who had previously purchased goods on credit, the company will make a debit entry of $500 in its Cash account and will make a credit entry of $500 in its asset account Accounts Receivable.", "Definition of Income Statement and Balance Sheet Accounts": "A company\u2019s general ledger accounts are arranged into two categories based on the financial statement where their amounts are reported:", "Examples of Accounts Affected by Transactions": "Most transactions typically affect either of the following:", "Definition of Dr.": "In accounting, dr. is the abbreviation for the Italian term used more than 500 years ago to indicate today\u2019s term debit. In accounting and bookkeeping, debit or dr. indicates an entry on the left side of a general ledger account or the left side of a T-account.", "Example of Dr.": "Typically, the general ledger accounts for assets and expenses will have debit (dr.) balances and the balances in the asset accounts will be increased with debit amounts. A debit (dr.) will also reduce the credit balances typically found in the revenue, liability, and stockholders\u2019 equity accounts.", "Definition of Wages Payable": "Wages payable refers to the wages that a company\u2019s employees have earned, but have not yet been paid. Under the accrual method of accounting, this amount is likely recorded with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period so that the company\u2019s balance sheet will include the amount as a current liability. (The adjusting entry typically debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable.)", "Example of Wages Payable": "To illustrate wages payable we will use the following hypothetical dates and other information. Jane is an hourly-paid sales clerk at a company that ends its accounting year on December 31. During the work week of Sunday December 22 through Saturday December 28 Jane earned $400 of wages that the company will pay to her on January 2. For the last three days of the year (December 29-31) Jane earned $160. This amount (plus any wages she earns from January 1-4) will be included in her January 9 paycheck. Given this information, the company has wages payable of $560 ($400 + $160) as of December 31.", "Reporting Wages Payable on the Balance Sheet": "The company\u2019s current liabilities on its December 31 balance sheet must include the $560 of wages payable that Jane had earned and the company owes as of December 31. (The company\u2019s income statement for the year that ends on December 31 must also report the $560  as part of its wages expense.) The amount in the account Wages Payable (or Accrued Wages Payable) will often be reported on the balance sheet as part of a current liability description such as accrued compensation, accrued payroll liabilities, accrued expenses, accrued liabilities, etc.  ", "Definition of Invoice": "An invoice is a dated bill prepared by the seller of goods sold (or services provided) which includes brief descriptions of the items, quantities of items and their unit prices, extensions (quantities X prices), the total amount, and the payment terms.

The purchaser of the goods or services will refer to the seller\u2019s sales invoice that it receives as a vendor invoice or purchase invoice.", "Definition of a Special Journal": "A special journal (also known as a specialized journal) is useful in a manual accounting or bookkeeping system to reduce the tedious task of recording both the debit and credit general ledger account names and amounts in a general journal.", "Example of a Special Journal": "One example of a special journal is the sales journal which is used exclusively for a company\u2019s sales of merchandise to customers that are allowed to pay at a future date. The sales journal will have only one column in which to enter the amount of each sales invoice. At the end of the month the total of the column is debited to Accounts Receivable and credited to Sales. Throughout the month, the individual sales invoices will be posted to each customer\u2019s record found in the company\u2019s subsidiary ledger for Accounts Receivable.   The benefits of using a special journal instead of the general journal for the repetitive transactions have been eliminated with today\u2019s inexpensive yet powerful accounting software. For example, when a sales invoice is prepared by using accounting software, both the general ledger and subsidiary accounts will be updated instantly and accurately.", "More Examples of Special Journals": "In addition to the sales journal (used for recording sales on credit), there are other special journals which were popular in manual accounting systems. The following special journals were more efficient than recording all transactions in the general journal:", "Definition of Reclassify an Amount": "To reclassify an amount likely means to move an amount from one general ledger account to another general ledger account.", "Example of Reclassifying an Amount": "Assume that a company\u2019s accountant recorded a vendor\u2019s invoice for $900 in the account Advertising Expenses. Upon review, the advertising manager informs the accountant that the amount should have been recorded in the account Marketing Supplies. If the accountant uses a journal entry to move the amount, the entry\u2019s description might be: To reclassify $900 from Advertising Expense to Marketing Supplies. The term reclassify has a gentler tone than the phrase to correct an account coding error.", "Definition of Adjunct Account": "An adjunct account is a general ledger account that is related to another general ledger account. The combination of the balance in the adjunct account and the other general ledger account is the carrying amount or book value of the main account.

Therefore, the carrying amount or book value of the equipment is $260,000.   Assume a company has sold goods on credit for $900,000. As a result, its Sales account was credited for $900,000 and Accounts Receivable was debited for $900,000. Several customers were disappointed in the goods they received and the company gave them a sales allowance of $10,000. In order to account for such allowances, the company will debit the contra sales account Sales Allowances for $10,000 (instead of debiting Sales) and credits Accounts Receivable. The company will likely combine the credit balance of $900,000 in the Sales account with the debit balance of $10,000 in the Sales Allowances account and report net sales of $890,000.", "Definition of Petty Cash Fund": "A petty cash fund is a small amount of money available to pay small amounts without requiring the processing of a business check.", "Example of Starting a Petty Cash Fund": "If a company wants to start a petty cash fund, a new general ledger account entitled Petty Cash must be opened. (This will be an additional cash account that can be listed separately on the company\u2019s balance sheet or its balance could be included with the balances in the other cash accounts.) Next, a company check is prepared and cashed for the amount the company believes will be best for the small payments it experiences. If the amount is $100, the company check will be coded to debit Petty Cash for $100 and to credit Cash for $100. One person should be designated to be the petty cash custodian. This person\u2019s name will be listed as the payee on the company\u2019s $100 check and will be accountable for the $100. At all times the custodian must have a combination of cash and petty cash vouchers/receipts which add up to $100. This is referred to as an imprest petty cash fund. Whenever the cash in the petty cash fund is low and just prior to issuing financial statements, the petty cash custodian should request cash for the petty cash receipts, which should be the amount to return the cash amount back to $100. This is known as replenishing the petty cash fund.", "Definition of Purchases and Inventory": "When a company uses the periodic inventory system the amount of the company\u2019s inventory is determined by a physical count at the end of the accounting year. Throughout the year the general ledger account Inventory is dormant and contains only the cost of the prior year\u2019s ending inventory. With the periodic inventory system, the costs of additional purchases of goods are debited to the temporary account Purchases. (There will also be temporary accounts that will be credited for Purchase Returns and Allowances and for Purchase Discounts.) When a company uses the perpetual inventory system, the general ledger account Inventory is continually being updated for all the purchases and sales of goods:", "Definition of Post-Closing Trial Balance": "The total amounts on a post-closing trial balance show that the accounts having debit balances = the accounts having credit balances.", "Example of Balance Sheet Totals": "Assets normally have debit balances. However, there are a few asset accounts that are expected to have credit balances. (These are known as contra asset accounts.) One example is Accumulated Depreciation. Let\u2019s assume that a company has property, plant and equipment with a cost of $200,000. The accumulated depreciation associated with these assets is $130,000. Therefore, the total assets reported on the balance sheet will report the net amount of $70,000.", "Example of Post-closing Trial Balance Totals": "Using the amounts above, the company\u2019s post-closing trial balance will report $200,000 in the debit column and $130,000 in the credit column. This will cause a difference of $130,000 between the balance sheet totals and the post-closing trial balance totals. Other examples of contra accounts that will result in the balance sheet totals being different from the post-closing trial balance totals include:", "Definition of Asset Account Balances": "In accounting, asset accounts normally have debit balances. That is, the general ledger accounts for assets typically have their balances on the left side. This is also the case with T-accounts and is consistent with the accounting equation ( Assets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity) where the asset account balances are on the left side. However, there are a few general ledger asset accounts that must have credit balances. These accounts are known as contra asset accounts since their credit balances are contrary to the usual debit balances found in most asset accounts.", "Examples of Asset Accounts with Credit Balances": "Two examples of contra asset accounts are:", "Definition of Transposition Error": "A transposition error occurs when an amount is recorded incorrectly as the result of switching the positions of two (or more) digits. The switching of the positions causes a difference (between the recorded amount and the correct amount) that will be evenly divisible by 9.", "Examples of Transposition Errors": "For example, if 986 was the correct amount, but it was recorded incorrectly as 968, the difference between the two amounts is 18. Since this difference is evenly divisible by 9 (18 divided by 9 = exactly 2), the mistake is described as a transposition error. Another example of the many possible transposition errors is recording 3662 as 3626. In this situation, the difference between the correct and incorrect amounts is 36. Because the difference is evenly divisible by 9 (36 divided by 9 = exactly 4), this indicates that the error could be the result of transposing digits.", "Determining Whether a Transposition Error Was Involved": "If you are faced with finding a difference between two amounts, you might save some time by first dividing the difference by 9. (A few differences that are evenly divisible by 9 include: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, etc.) Knowing that the error could be a transposition error may lead you to first review the more relevant amounts.", "Definition of Discount on Purchase of Office Furniture": "The discount on the purchase of office furniture that will be used by a company (as opposed to being resold by a furniture retailer) is recorded in the same asset account in which the office furniture is recorded, such as Furniture and Fixtures or Office Furniture. In other words, the discount is a reduction of the asset\u2019s cost. [If the discount is received by a retailer who is in the business of buying and selling office furniture, the discount is likely recorded in the general ledger account Purchase Discounts.]", "Example of Discount on Purchase of Office Furniture": "Assume that a company purchases furniture for the office of a newly appointed executive. The cost of the furniture is $10,000 and the invoice allows an early payment discount of 1% if it is paid within 10 days.

When GoodCorp receives the 100 units of product, it discovers that 5 of the units were defective. After informing SalesMax, SalesMax issued a credit memo for $60 (5 units X $12) and asks GoodCorp to destroy or donate the 5 units. SalesMax will record the $60 credit memo by debiting Sales Returns and Allowances for $60 and crediting Accounts Receivable by $60.

The balance in Notes Payable represents the amounts that remain to be paid. Since a note payable will require the issuer/borrower to pay interest, the issuing company will have interest expense. Under the accrual method of accounting, the company will also have another liability account entitled Interest Payable.

During the current year the company debits Depreciation Expense for $10,000 and credits Accumulated Depreciation for $10,000. Therefore, at the end of the current year the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation is $55,000. By crediting the account Accumulated Depreciation instead of crediting the Equipment account, the balance sheet at the end of the year can easily report both the equipment\u2019s cost of $70,000 and its accumulated depreciation of $55,000, the net of which is $15,000. This is more informative than reporting only the net amount of $15,000 (which would likely be the case if the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation was not used).", "Examples on Notes Payable": "Notes payable are required when a company borrows money from a bank or other lender.

Let\u2019s also assume that a sales invoice is for $1,000 and the buyer has been authorized to return $100 of goods. Therefore, the net amount due to the seller within 30 days is $900. However, the buyer may deduct $9 (1% of $900) if the buyer pays the seller $891 within 10 days of the invoice date. The seller will usually record the $9 cash discount with a debit to the account Sales Discounts. The buyer will record the $9 savings as a credit to Purchase Discounts or as a reduction to the cost recorded in inventory. My dentist offers a 5% cash discount if the dental fee is paid on the day of the service.

If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an expense (cost of goods sold), then at the end of the year the retailer\u2019s adjusting entry must debit Inventory for $100 (since the inventory has increased from $800 to $900). The other account in this adjusting entry is the expense Cost of Goods Sold which is credited for $100. As a result, the income statement will report the cost of goods sold at $6,900 ($7,000 minus the $100 credit). The balance sheet will report inventory of $900 ($800 plus the debit of $100). If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an asset, the Inventory account balance increases from $800 to $7,800. Since the actual inventory at the end of the year is $900, the adjusting entry must credit Inventory for $6,900 ($7,800 minus $900) and debit Cost of Goods Sold for $6,900. Regardless of whether the goods purchased were initially recorded as an expense or as an asset, the amounts must be adjusted so that the financial statements report the expense (reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement for the year) at $6,900 and the asset inventory (reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the year) at $900.", "Examples of Two Methods for Recording Prepaid Expenses": "One method for recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in an asset account.

If the company withholds $2,000 from its employees\u2019 wages to pay part of the cost of the insurance, the company will credit its contra expense account 4211 Employee Withholdings for Health Ins. The benefit of using the contra expense account is that the company\u2019s managers can see in account 4210 the total amount that the company paid to the health insurance company. Then in account 4211 they can see the portion of the cost that was paid by the employees.

The debit balances in these valuation accounts will be combined with the credit balance in Bonds Payable in order to report the carrying value or carrying amount of the bonds. Premium on Bonds Payable is a valuation account with a credit balance.", "Definition of Deposit on Utilities": "A new customer of a public utility (electricity, natural gas, telephone, etc.) may be required to pay a refundable amount known as a utility deposit or security deposit before the public utility will provide services. After a period of time, the public utility will refund the customer\u2019s utility deposit.", "Example of Recording a Deposit on Utilities": "Assume that a new business is required to pay $500 as a security deposit to an electric utility before the utility provides electricity. The deposit will be refunded by the utility after six months of timely payments.  The new business will record the deposit with a $500 debit to the current asset account Utilities Deposits and will credit the asset account Cash for $500. The electric utility will record the customer\u2019s security deposit with a $500 credit to the current liability account Customers\u2019 Security Deposits and will debit its Cash account for $500.", "Definition of Capital Surplus": "In the past, capital surplus was used to describe what is now referred to as paid-in capital in excess of par or Premium on Common Stock.", "Example of Capital Surplus": "Today, if a corporation issues shares of its common\u00a0stock and receives more than its par value, two accounts are involved:", "Definition of Permanent Account": "In accounting, a permanent account refers to a general ledger account that is not closed at the end of an accounting year. The balance in a permanent account is carried forward to the subsequent year, where it becomes the beginning balance for the new year. Permanent accounts are also known as real accounts.", "Examples of Permanent Accounts": "Generally, the balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts, except for the owner\u2019s drawing account which is a balance sheet account and a temporary account. (The owner\u2019s drawing account is a temporary account because its balance is closed to the owner\u2019s capital account at the end of each year in order to begin the next year with a $0 balance.)  Examples of permanent accounts are:", "Definition of Net Purchases": "Net purchases refers to the combination of the amounts found in the following general ledger temporary accounts:", "Example of Net Purchases": "To illustrate the calculation of net purchases, assume that a company had the following general ledger account balances at the end of its accounting year:", "Definition of Depreciation Accounts": "There are two types of general ledger accounts in which depreciation is recorded:", "Example of Depreciation Accounts": "Assume a company has equipment which is used in its business. The equipment\u2019s cost was $600,000 and is expected to last for 10 years at which time it will be scrapped for no salvage value. Using the straight-line depreciation method, the monthly depreciation will be $5,000 per month ($600,000/120 months). Therefore, each month for 10 years the company will record the following adjusting entry:", "Definition of Wages": "Wages are usually associated with employee compensation that is based on the number of hours worked multiplied by an hourly rate of pay. Generally, the employees earning hourly wages will be paid in the week that follows the hours worked.", "Example of Wages": "For example, a warehouse employee works 40 hours during the work week. If the employee\u2019s hourly rate of pay is $15, on the 5th day following the work week, the employee will receive a paycheck showing gross wages of $600 (40 x $15). If the employee had worked only 30 hours during the work week, the paycheck will show gross wages of $450 (30 x $15).", "Definition of Salary": "Salary is associated with employee compensation quoted on an annual basis, such as $50,000 per year. Many employees working in a company\u2019s general office will be paid a salary. Often the salaries are paid semi-monthly. That is, one pay date will be the 15th day of the month for working from the 1st to the 15th, and the other pay date will be the last day of the month for working from the 16th to the last day of the month.", "Example of Salary": "To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that the manager of a company might earn a salary of $120,000 per year. If the manager is paid semi-monthly each paycheck will show a gross salary of $5,000 for half a month\u2019s work.", "Overtime Pay": "U.S. and state law protects employees from having to work more than 40 hours per week when their wages or salary is below a certain level. In other words, a salaried employee with a relatively low annual salary must be given overtime compensation if the person\u2019s hours worked are greater than 40 hours per week. You should be aware of the federal and state laws for your employees\u2019 overtime compensation.", "Significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination": "The terms FOB shipping point and FOB destination have significance in accounting because they determine the following:", "Example of FOB Shipping Point": "Assume that a seller quoted a price of $900 FOB shipping point and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are in transit until they arrive at the buyer\u2019s location on January 2. On December 30, the seller should record a sale, an account receivable, and a reduction in its inventory. The buyer should record the purchase, the account payable, and the increase in its inventory as of December 30 (the date that the purchase took place). Since the goods on the truck belong to the buyer, the buyer should pay the shipping costs. These shipping costs will be an additional cost of the goods purchased.", "Example of FOB Destination": "Now assume that a seller quoted $975 FOB destination and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are on the truck until January 2, when they are unloaded at the buyer\u2019s location. On December 31, the goods were owned by the seller. Therefore, the seller should continue to report these goods in its inventory until January 2. The seller will be responsible for the shipping costs, which will be an expense in January when the sale is reported. The buyer records the purchase, accounts payable, and the increase in inventory on January 2 when the buyer becomes the owner of the goods.", "Definition of Three-Way Match": "In the accounting and bookkeeping area of accounts payable, the three-way match refers to a procedure used when processing an invoice received from a vendor or supplier. The purpose of the three-way match is to avoid paying an incorrect and perhaps fraudulent invoice.", "Example of Three-Way Match": "The \u201cthree-way\u201d part of the three-way match refers to the three documents that will be compared:", "Examples of a Liability": "Examples of a liability include:", "Definition of Provision for Bad Debts": "The provision for bad debts could refer to the balance sheet account also known as the Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. If so, the account Provision for Bad Debts is a contra asset account (an asset account with a credit balance). It is used along with the account Accounts Receivable in order for the balance sheet to report the net realizable value of the company\u2019s accounts receivable. The entry to increase the credit balance in these contra accounts is a debit to the income statement account Bad Debts Expense. Some companies might use the description provision for bad debts on its income statement in order to report the credit losses that pertain to the period of the income statement. In that case, provision for bad debts would be an income statement account. However, the U.S. accounting textbooks are more likely to use Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense to describe the amount reported on the income statement.", "Definition of Credit Memo": "One type of credit memo is issued by a seller in order to reduce the amount that a customer owes from a previously issued sales invoice. Another type of credit memo, or credit memorandum, is issued by a bank when it increases a depositor\u2019s checking account for a certain transaction.", "Example of a Credit Memo": "Assume that SellerCorp had issued a sales invoice for $800 for 100 units of product that it shipped to BuyerCo at a price of $8 each. BuyerCo informs SellerCorp that one of the units is defective. SellerCorp will then issue a credit memo for $8. The credit memo will result in the following entry in SellerCorp\u2019s accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Sales Returns and Allowances, and 2) a credit of $8 to Accounts Receivable. In other words, the credit memo reduced SellerCorp\u2019s net sales and its accounts receivable.  When BuyerCo records the credit memo, the following will occur in its accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Accounts Payable, and 2) a credit of $8 to Purchases Returns and Allowances (or to Inventory).", "Are Retained Earnings an Asset?": "While the amount of a corporation\u2019s retained earnings is reported in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of the balance sheet, the cash that was generated from those retained earnings is not likely be in the company\u2019s checking account. Instead, the corporation likely used the cash to acquire additional assets in order to generate additional earnings for its stockholders. In some cases, the corporation will use the cash from the retained earnings to reduce its liabilities. As a result, it is difficult to identify exactly where the retained earnings are presently. One can get a sense of how the retained earnings have been used by studying the corporation\u2019s balance sheet and its statement of cash flows.  ", "Where do Retained Earnings Come From?": "At the end of an accounting year, the balances in a corporation\u2019s revenue, gain, expense, and loss accounts are used to compute the year\u2019s net income. Those account balances are then transferred to the Retained Earnings account. When the year\u2019s revenues and gains exceed the expenses and losses, the corporation will have a positive net income which causes the balance in the Retained Earnings account to increase. (If the corporation\u2019s revenues and gains for the year are less than the expenses and losses, the result is a net loss that reduces the normal credit balance in the Retained Earnings account.) The balance in the Retained Earnings account is also decreased when the corporation declares a cash dividend. ", "What is the Normal Balance in the Retained Earnings Account?": "The normal balance in a profitable corporation\u2019s Retained Earnings account is a credit balance. This is logical since the revenue accounts have credit balances and expense accounts have debit balances. If the balance in the Retained Earnings account has a debit balance, this negative amount of retained earnings may be described as deficit or accumulated deficit.", "Definition of Revenue Received in Advance": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability. When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues. As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.", "Examples of Revenue Received in Advance": "The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:", "Definition of Payment for Insurance": "A company\u2019s property insurance, liability insurance, business interruption insurance, etc. often covers a one-year period with the cost (insurance premiums) paid in advance. The one-year period for the insurance rarely coincides with the company\u2019s accounting year. Therefore, the insurance payments will likely involve more than one annual financial statement and many interim financial statements.", "Prepaid Insurance vs. Insurance Expense": "When the insurance premiums are paid in advance, they are referred to as prepaid. The amount of the insurance premiums that remain prepaid at the end of each accounting period are reported in the current asset account, Prepaid Insurance. The balance in this account will be combined with the balances in other prepaid expense accounts and will be listed on the balance sheet as prepaid expenses. As the prepaid amount expires, the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced by a credit to Prepaid Insurance and a debit to Insurance Expense. This is done with an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period (e.g. monthly). One objective of the adjusting entry is to match the proper amount of insurance expense to the period indicated on the income statement.", "Example of Payment for Insurance Expense": "Let\u2019s assume that a company is started on December 1 and arranges for business insurance to begin on December 1. On December 1 the company pays the insurance company $12,000 for the insurance premiums covering one year. The company will record the payment with a debit of $12,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $12,000 to Cash. On December 31, the company writes an adjusting entry to record the insurance expense that was used up (expired) and to reduce the amount that remains prepaid. This is accomplished with a debit of $1,000 to Insurance Expense and a credit of $1,000 to Prepaid Insurance. This same adjusting entry will be prepared at the end of each of the next 11 months.", "Definition of Journal Entry for Depreciation": "The journal entry for depreciation is:", "Purpose of Journal Entry for Depreciation": "The purpose of the journal entry for depreciation is to achieve the matching principle. In each accounting period, part of the cost of certain assets (equipment, building, vehicle, etc.) will be moved from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement. The goal is to match the cost of the asset to the revenues in the accounting periods in which the asset is being used.", "More Information on the Depreciation Entry": "It is important to understand the following:", "Definition of Sundry": "Sundry can mean various, miscellaneous, or diverse.", "Definition of Sundry Debtors": "Sundry debtors could be referring to a company\u2019s customers who rarely make purchases on credit and the amounts are not significant.", "Example of Sundry Debtors": "I suspect that the term sundry was more common when bookkeeping was done manually. For instance, prior to the low cost of computers and accounting software, the bookkeeper had to add a page to the company\u2019s subsidiary ledger book for every new customer. Adding a new page for every occasional customer could result in a subsidiary ledger book that was unwieldy. Therefore, it was more practical to have one page entitled sundry  on which those occasional customers\u2019 small transactions were entered. With the efficiency and low cost of today\u2019s accounting systems, the need for classifying customers and accounts as sundry has been eliminated.", "Definition of Net Assets": "Net assets is defined as total assets  minus total liabilities.", "Examples of Net Assets": "In a sole proprietorship the amount of net assets is reported as owner\u2019s equity. In a corporation the amount of net assets is reported as stockholders\u2019 equity. In a not-for-profit (NFP) organization, the net amount of its total assets minus total liabilities is actually reported as net assets in its statement of financial position. The net assets section for the NFP organization is divided into two major classifications:", "Definition of Loan Principal Payment": "When a company borrows money from its bank, the amount received is recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account, such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable, which is reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet. The cash received from the bank loan is referred to as the principal amount. The principal amount received from the bank is not part of a company\u2019s revenues and therefore will not be reported on the company\u2019s income statement. Similarly, any repayment of the principal amount will not be an expense and therefore will not be reported on the income statement. The principal payment is recorded as a reduction of the liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable. (Both the receipt of the loan principal amount and the repayment of the loan principal will be reported on the statement of cash flows.) The interest on the loan will be reported as expense on the income statement in the periods when the interest is incurred.", "Example of a Loan Principal Payment": "Let\u2019s assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company\u2019s cash increases by $10,000 and its liability Loans Payable increases by $10,000. Let\u2019s also assume that the company makes a payment of $1,000 consisting of $60 for interest and $940 for principal, the entry will be:", "Definition of Source Document": "A source document is an original record which contains the detail that supports or substantiates a transaction that will be (or has been) entered in an accounting system. In the past, source documents were printed on paper. Today, the source documents may be an electronic record.", "Examples of Source Documents": "A few examples of a company\u2019s source documents include:", "Definition of Transportation-in Costs": "Transportation-in costs, which are also known as freight-in costs, are part of the cost of goods purchased. The reason is that accountants define \u201ccost\u201d as all costs necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. If a company purchases goods with terms such as FOB shipping point, the company will be responsible for any costs to get the products from the seller to the company\u2019s warehouse. In that situation, the company using the periodic system will likely have a purchases account entitled Transportation-in or Freight-in. (If goods are purchased with terms of FOB destination, the buyer will not have a separate transportation-in cost, because the seller is responsible for the costs of getting the goods to the buyer\u2019s location.)  Transportation-in costs should be allocated or assigned to the products purchased. Therefore, the unsold products in inventory should include a portion of the transportation-in costs. The products that have been sold, should have their share of the transportation-in costs in the cost of goods sold).", "Example of Transportation-in Costs": "Let\u2019s assume that a bookstore purchases 20 copies of a bestselling book for $20 each and the terms are FOB shipping point. The shipping cost to get the books from the publisher to the bookstore amounts to $40. Therefore, this transportation-in cost of $40 amounts to $2 per book, resulting in a cost per book of $22. If 16 books are sold, the cost of goods sold will be $352 (16 X $22) and the inventory cost of the remaining 4 books will be $88 (4 X $22). In total, the bookstore had purchases of $400 + transportation-in cost of $40, resulting in the cost of goods available of $440. When we subtract the $88 cost of inventory, there is $352 as the cost of goods sold.", "Definition of an Imprest System of Petty Cash": "An imprest system of petty cash means that the general ledger account Petty Cash will remain dormant at a constant amount. If the amount of petty cash is $100, then the Petty Cash account will always report a debit balance of $100. This $100 is the imprest balance. As long as $100 is adequate for the organization\u2019s small disbursements, then the general ledger account Petty Cash will never be debited or credited again. When the currency and coins on hand gets low, the petty cash custodian will request a check to replenish the coins and currency that were disbursed. Since the requested check is drawn on the organization\u2019s checking account, the Cash account (not the Petty Cash account) will be credited. The debits will go to the expense accounts indicated by the petty cash receipts, such as postage expense, supplies expense. In other words, the general ledger account Petty Cash is not involved in the replenishment. (Replenishment means getting the total of the currency and coins back to the imprest amount.) The petty cash custodian will cash the check and add the amount to the other cash.  Under the imprest system, the petty cash custodian should at all times have a combination of currency, coins, and petty cash receipts that equals $100 (the imprest petty cash balance). Control over the petty cash occurs during the replenishment process. The person approving the check for the petty cash custodian to cash should review the petty cash receipts and attach them to the check request. Control can also occur when an independent person confirms that the petty cash custodian\u2019s cash and receipts adds up to the imprest amount.", "Definition of Goods Purchased at a Discount": "There are two common types of discounts for companies buying goods to resell:", "Examples of Entries for Goods Purchased at a Discount": "Trade discount. Some suppliers have catalogs with prices before any discounts. Let\u2019s assume that the supplier gives companies that purchase a high volume of goods a trade discount of 30%. A small volume buyer receives only a 10% discount. If a high volume company purchases $40,000 of goods, its cost will be $28,000 ($40,000 X 70%). To comply with the cost principle the company will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $28,000 and will credit Accounts Payable for $28,000. Early payment discount. Some suppliers offer discounts of 1% or 2% from the sales invoice amount, if the invoice is paid in 10 days instead of the usual 30 days. For instance, let\u2019s assume that a company purchases goods and the supplier\u2019s sales invoice is $28,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. This means that the company can deduct $280 (1% of $28,000) if it pays the invoice within 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay $28,000 within 30 days. The early payment discount is also referred to as a purchase discount or cash discount. If the company pays the supplier\u2019s invoice within 10 days, there are two ways to record the early payment discount of $280:", "Definition of Bad Debts Expense": "Bad debts expense is related to a company\u2019s current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.", "Examples of Bad Debts Expense": "There are two methods for reporting the amount of bad debts expense:", "Definition of a Voucher": "A voucher is an internal document used by a company\u2019s accounts payable department in order to collect and organize the necessary documentation and approvals before paying a vendor\u2019s invoice. The voucher acts as a cover page to which the following will be attached: vendor\u2019s invoice, company\u2019s purchase order, company\u2019s receiving report, and other information needed to further process the vendor\u2019s invoice for payment.", "Definition of Inventory Account in Periodic Method": "Under the periodic method or periodic system, the account Inventory is dormant throughout the accounting year and will report only the cost of the prior year\u2019s ending inventory. The current year\u2019s purchases are recorded in one or more temporary accounts entitled Purchases. At the end of the accounting year, the beginning balance in the account Inventory must be changed so that it reports the cost (or perhaps lower than the cost) of the ending inventory.", "Examples of Adjusting the Inventory Account": "When using the periodic method, balance in the inventory account can be changed to the ending inventory\u2019s cost by recording an adjusting entry. To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that the cost of a company\u2019s beginning inventory (last year\u2019s ending inventory) was $35,000. This balance will be the only amount in the account Inventory until the end of the year. Let\u2019s assume that at the end of the year a physical count of inventory is taken and it has an actual cost of $40,000. To adjust the Inventory account balance from a debit balance of $35,000 to a debit balance of $40,000, the following adjusting entry will be needed:", "Definition of Subsidiary Ledger": "A subsidiary ledger contains the details to support a general ledger control account. For instance, the subsidiary ledger for accounts receivable contains the information for each of the company\u2019s credit sales to customers, each customer\u2019s remittance, return of merchandise,\u00a0discounts, and so on. With these details in the subsidiary ledger, the Accounts Receivable account in the general ledger can report summary amounts for the accounts receivable activity.", "Examples of Subsidiary Ledgers": "By having the details of the accounts receivable activity in a subsidiary ledger, employees in a company\u2019s credit department of a company can access the credit sales information without having access to any information in the general ledger. In job order costing systems, the job cost sheets (or job cost records) will serve as the subsidiary ledger containing the details for the general ledger account Work in Process. The Work in Process account will now be a control account containing summary amounts for direct materials, direct labor, factory overhead applied, transfers to finished goods, etc. Manufacturing personnel will have full access to the job cost sheets without having access to other information in the general ledger. Since\u00a0companies are integrating\u00a0accounting records with their other information into one database, I assume there will be less use of the term subsidiary ledgers in the future. There will likely be reports generated to provide the information formerly contained in\u00a0the subsidiary ledger.", "Definition of Materiality": "In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000. Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial.  ", "Example of Materiality": "A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket. Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.", "Definition of Petty Cash Voucher": "A petty cash voucher is usually a small form that is used to document a disbursement (payment) from a petty cash fund. Petty cash vouchers are also referred to as petty cash receipts and can be purchased from office supply stores. The petty cash voucher should provide space for the following:", "Example of Petty Cash Voucher": "Shown below is an example of a petty cash voucher. ", "Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable": "Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors\u2019 invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.", "Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable": "In addition to the amounts associated with vendors\u2019 invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.", "Definition of Monthly Close": "In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company\u2019s monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting. Since a company\u2019s business activities are ongoing, accountants might state \u201cwe need to get a proper \u201ccut-off\u201d between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month. If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories. Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month\u2019s amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.", "Definition of Trade Discount": "A trade discount is a routine reduction from the regular, established price of a product. The use of trade discounts allows a company to vary the final price based on each customer\u2019s volume or status. Note that trade discounts are different from early-payment discounts. (Early-payment discounts of 1% or 2% are usually recorded by the seller in an account such as Sales Discounts and by the buyer using the periodic inventory method in an account such as Purchase Discounts.) Trade discounts are not recorded in a separate account by either the seller or the buyer.", "Example of Trade Discounts": "A distributor of merchandise may have a single catalog which displays a single price for each product. However, the distributor allows a trade discount from the catalog price based on each customer\u2019s volume. For example, one product may have a catalog price of $100. A casual buyer will be charged $100. However, a reseller will be given a trade discount of 20% from the catalog price, and will be charged $80. Lastly, a registered high-volume wholesaler will be given a trade discount of 27% and will be charged $73.", "Recording Sales Having a Trade Discount": "The company selling the product (and the buyer of the product) will record the transaction at the amount after the trade discount is subtracted. For example, when goods with list prices totaling $1,000 are sold to a wholesaler that is entitled to a 27% trade discount, both the seller and the buyer will record the transaction at $730. There will not be a general ledger account entitled Trade Discount.", "Definition of Voucher": "A voucher is often a prenumbered form used in the accounts payable department to standardize and enhance a company\u2019s internal control over payments to its vendors and service providers.", "Example of a Voucher": "You could think of the voucher used in accounts payable as a cover sheet to which necessary supporting documents and approvals are attached.

Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount of accrued interest is to be recorded with accrual adjusting entries by the borrower and the lender before issuing their financial statements. The borrower\u2019s adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense and credit Accrued Interest Payable (a current liability). The lender\u2019s adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable (a current asset) and credit Interest Revenue (or Income).", "Example of Accrued Interest": "Let\u2019s assume that on December 16, a company borrows $20,000 from its bank at an annual interest rate of 6%. The first interest payment is due 30 days later on January 15. Both the company and the bank have accounting years which end on December 31. The accrued interest as of December 31 is $50 ($20,000 X 6% = $1,200 per year = $100 per month = $50 for 1/2 month). The company\u2019s adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense for $50, and will credit Accrued Interest Payable for $50. The bank\u2019s adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable for $50, and will credit Interest Revenue for $50.", "Definition of Bank Balance": "The term bank balance is commonly used when reconciling the bank statement. It is also known as the balance per bank or balance per bank statement. Typically it is the ending balance on the bank statement for each month.", "Example of Bank Balance": "When a company receives its checking account statement from its bank showing June\u2019s activity, the ending balance on June 30 is the bank balance. (Generally, this bank balance will not agree with the amount in the company\u2019s records since some checks written by the company will not have cleared the bank by June 30. Similarly, some money received by the company on June 30 may not have been deposited in time for the amount to appear on the June bank statement.)", "Definition of Book Balance": "The term book balance, which is also used in the bank reconciliation is the amount shown in the company\u2019s general ledger for the bank account. Book balance is also referred to as the balance per books.", "Example of Book Balance": "The balance on June 30 in the company\u2019s general ledger account entitled Checking Account is the book balance that pertains to the bank account being reconciled. (For an individual, the book balance is likely to be the balance appearing in the person\u2019s check register.) It is common for the book balance to not agree with the balance on the bank statement as of the same day. This is the case when there are bank fees or electronic transfers on the bank statement that have not yet been recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger accounts. For example, the bank statement may reveal that a bank service charge was withdrawn from the account on the last day of the month.", "Definition of Unearned Income": "Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.", "Example #1 of Unearned Income": "A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company\u2019s remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.", "Example #2 of Unearned Income": "A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer\u2019s special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.", "Definition of Aging": "In accounting,  the term aging  is often associated with a company\u2019s accounts receivable. Accounts receivable arise when a company provides goods or services and allows the customer to pay 10 or 30 days later. If some customers do not honor the terms of the sale, the company can experience a temporary or even permanent cash flow problem. In order for the company to minimize these potential problems, a company is wise to routinely review an aging of accounts receivable.  The aging of accounts receivable sorts the company\u2019s accounts receivables by customer and then by time since the sales invoice was issued. Generally, the older the unpaid sales invoice, the greater the likelihood of not collecting the full amount. Since the aging of accounts receivable is a standard feature of accounting software, it is available with a click of the mouse. The aging is also useful for estimating the amount needed in the related account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.", "Example of an Aging Report": "The aging report lists each customer\u2019s name and its unpaid sales invoices that make up the account receivable balance. Then the amounts of each unpaid sales invoice are placed in one of six columns that appear to the right. The headings for those columns are: Current, 1-30 days past due, 31-60 days past due, 61-90 days past due, 91-120 days past due, and 120+ days past due. The aging of accounts receivable gives the company\u2019s management a valuable and easy-to-read report that highlights the customers with past due sales invoices.  An aging can also be prepared for the company\u2019s accounts payable. The aging of accounts payable is based on the dates that the vendors\u2019 invoices are to be paid.", "Definition of Gift Certificates": "Gift certificates (and gift cards) are often sold by a retailer to a buyer for cash. The buyer can then redeem the gift certificate or give it to another person who can redeem the gift certificate for merchandise or services.", "Accounting for the Sale of Gift Certificates": "The sale of a gift certificate should be recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account such as Gift Certificates Outstanding. Note that revenue is not recorded at this point. Rather, the retailer is recording its obligation/liability to provide merchandise or services for the amount of the certificate sold.", "Accounting for the Redemption of a Gift Certificate": "When a gift certificate is presented to the retailer,  revenue will be recorded by the retailer for the amount of merchandise or services that were provided. This is done with a debit to the liability account Gift Certificates Outstanding and a credit to a revenue account. Our explanation pertains to financial accounting. To learn about the income tax treatment of this transaction, you should seek advice from a tax professional or go to www.irs.gov.", "Definition of Income Received in Advance": "Under the accrual method of accounting, when a company receives money from a customer prior to earning it, the company will have to make the following entry:", "Example of Income Received in Advance": "Assume that Jones Corporation received $10,000 from a customer on December 31 for work that will be done in the following month. On December 31, Jones Corporation will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Deferred Revenue for $10,000. Therefore, Jones Corporation\u2019s December 31 balance sheet\u2019s Cash will include the $10,000 and its current liabilities will report Deferred Revenue of $10,000. After Jones Corporation delivers the goods or services, it will debit Deferred Revenue for $10,000 and will credit Sales Revenues or Service Revenues for $10,000. ", "Definition of Carriage Inwards": "Carriage inwards refers to the transportation costs required to be paid by the purchaser when it receives merchandise it ordered with terms FOB shipping point. Carriage inwards is also known as freight-in or transportation-in. Carriage inwards is considered to be part of the cost of the items purchased. Hence, for inventory items carriage inwards will be part of the cost of the goods available, the cost of inventory, and the cost of goods sold.", "Example of Carriage Inwards": "Assume that a company uses the periodic inventory method and it purchases goods with terms FOB shipping point. As a result the company is responsible for paying the cost of the carriage inwards. The company will record the amount in the general ledger account Carriage Inwards (or Freight-in or Transportation-in). The carriage inwards costs are considered to be part of the cost of items purchased, since an asset\u2019s cost is defined as all costs that are necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.", "Definition of Insurance Expense": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, insurance expense is the cost of insurance that has been incurred, has expired, or has been used up during the current accounting period for the nonmanufacturing functions of a business. A manufacturer will report on its income statement the insurance expense incurred for its selling, general and administrative functions. However, the insurance costs associated with the manufacturing function are included in the cost of the current period\u2019s output.

(The company had not yet provided the customer with the associated goods or services.) In other words, the company received the asset Cash and has the obligation to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. Hence, the current liability account Customer Deposits is credited. When the company earns the deposit amount, Customer Deposits will be debited and Sales Revenues will be credited. A customer deposit could also refer to the money a bank received from a depositor. Since the bank has not earned this money, the amount is recorded by the bank with a debit to its asset account Cash and a credit to the bank\u2019s liability account Customer Deposits.", "Example of Customer Deposit": "Let\u2019s assume that Ace Manufacturing Inc. agrees to produce an expensive, custom-made machine for one of its customers. Ace requires that the customer pay $50,000 before Ace begins to design and construct the machine. The $50,000 payment is made in December 2023 and the machine must be finished by March 31, 2024. The $50,000 is a down payment toward the machine\u2019s price of $400,000. In December 2023 Ace will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit Customer Deposits, a current liability account. When the machine is completed in 2024, Ace will debit Customer Deposits for $50,000 and will credit Sales Revenues for $50,000. Let\u2019s break down the above customer deposit example step by step.

March 2024\nAce completes the custom-made machine by March 31, 2024, as agreed. ", "Definition of Sales Tax": "In the U.S., a sales tax is a state tax (and possibly an additional city and/or county tax) that is paid by the buyer at the time of purchase. The sales tax is based on certain products\u2019 (or services\u2019) selling prices and the sales tax rate. For instance, in some states unprepared grocery items are not subject to a sales tax. Items purchased for resale are not subject to the sales tax when purchased by the retailer, but will be subject to the sales tax when the items are sold to the end customer. In some cities, there could be a state sales tax of 6% plus a county tax of 1% and a tourist district sales tax of 3%. In another state there could be only a sales tax rate of 8%. The sales taxes collected by a merchant are not part of the merchant\u2019s sales and are not part of the merchant\u2019s expenses. Instead, the merchant is merely an agent of the state and will record the sales taxes collected in a current liability account such as Sales Taxes Payable. When the merchant remits the sales taxes to the state, the current liability account is reduced. If a company purchases a new delivery van, the sales taxes paid on the van are recorded as part of the cost of the van. The total cost of the van will then be charged to depreciation expense over the van\u2019s useful life.", "Examples of Sales Tax": "If a company sells $100,000 of merchandise that is subject to a state sales tax of 7%, the company will collect $107,000.

Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period). The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset\u2019s useful life.", "Definition of Accrued Payroll": "Accrued payroll includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other payroll related expenses that have been earned by a company\u2019s employees, but have not yet been paid or recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger accounts.", "Example of Accrued Payroll": "Let\u2019s assume that a retailer\u2019s hourly-paid employees are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. Let\u2019s also assume that as of December 31, the hours worked from December 27 through December 31 will be part of the payroll that will be processed in early January and paid to the employees on Friday, January 8. The amount of the wages for the five days of December 27 through December 31 are calculated to be $5,000. In addition, the retailer incurred payroll taxes and fringe benefits amounting to $1,000.

(If the check is not cashed within a certain number of years, the company will have to remit the amount of the uncashed check to its state government as unclaimed property.) If the payee says the check was never received, the company should issue a replacement check for $124 and send it to the payee. The replacement check for $124 should be credited to the company\u2019s general ledger Cash account and also debited to the same Cash account since the original check is being eliminated.

The depreciable cost of $300,000 ($325,000 \u2013 $25,000) is divided by the 5 years of useful life to arrive at the straight-line depreciation expense of $60,000 for a full year or $5,000 per month ($300,000/60 months).  Accountants and income tax regulations often assume that plant assets will have no salvage value. This will result in an asset\u2019s entire cost being depreciated during the years that the asset is used in the business.

Using a restrictive endorsement is one of many actions that a company can take in order to improve the internal control of its assets.", "Examples of Restrictive Endorsements": "The most common restrictive endorsement is the phrase For Deposit Only  written along with the payee\u2019s signature on the back of a check. A similar restrictive endorsement might be Pay to the Order of Sample Bank for deposit to account #xxxx followed by the payee\u2019s signature. Many companies endorse checks by using a rubber stamp containing this restriction. Another example of a restrictive endorsement is Pay to the order of John Doe, which allows only John Doe to cash the check.", "Definition of Sale of Land": "Assume that a retailer sells land that it had been holding for a future store. The retailer must remove the cost of the land from its general ledger asset account Land, record the cash received, and record the gain or loss on the sale of the land. ", "Example of Sale of Land": "Assume that the retailer had purchased the parcel of land 15 years earlier for $200,000 in order to add another retail store. The retailer now decides to sell the parcel for $500,000.  Since there was no depreciation on the land, the retailer records the sale as follows:", "Social Security Payroll Tax": "The Social Security payroll tax is 6.2% and is based on each employee\u2019s earnings (wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, etc.) up to a specified annual ceiling, limit, or maximum. In the calendar year 2022, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee\u2019s earnings up to the maximum of $147,000. The amount withheld from employees is then matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2022 is equal to 12.4% of each employee\u2019s annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $147,000. In the calendar year 2023, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee\u2019s earnings up to the maximum of $160,200. The Social Security tax withheld from employees is then matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2023 is equal to 12.4% of each employee\u2019s annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $160,200.", "Medicare Payroll Tax": "The Medicare payroll tax is 1.45% and is based on each employee\u2019s earnings without limit. The Medicare tax withheld from employees is then matched by the employer. This makes the total Medicare tax equal to 2.9% on every dollar of employees\u2019 earnings. (There is also an Additional Medicare Tax for high income employees and high income self-employed individuals. However, the Additional Medicare Tax is not matched by the employer.)", "FICA Payroll Tax": "The combination of Social Security payroll taxes and Medicare payroll taxes is referred to as FICA. We often refer to the FICA tax rate as 7.65% (6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare) of each employee\u2019s first $147,000 of annual earnings in 2022 and the first $160,200 of annual earnings in 2023. Each employee\u2019s earnings in excess of the annual ceiling amount are taxed only for Medicare (1.45% for the employee and 1.45% for the employer). As mentioned above, there is also an Additional Medicare Tax that is withheld from high income employees\u2019 pay, but not matched by the employer. Self-employed persons are responsible for both the employee and employer portions of FICA. Social Security involves retirement and disability benefits. Medicare involves health care for people 65 years of age and older.", "Definition of Accrual Adjusting Entries": "Accrual adjusting entries or simply accruals are one of three types of adjusting entries which are prepared at the end of an accounting period so that a company\u2019s financial statements will comply with the accrual method of accounting. Expressed another way, accrual adjusting entries are the means for including transactions that occurred during the current accounting period but have not yet been recorded in a company\u2019s general ledger accounts. Without accrual adjusting entries those transactions will likely be reported in a later accounting period. This means that the financial statements for two accounting periods will be reporting incorrect amounts.", "Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Expenses": "To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that New Corp begins its business on December 1 and uses Sales Rep Company for calling on customers. For this service, New Corp agrees to pay commissions of 5% of sales with payment made 10 days after the month ends. Assuming that December\u2019s sales are $100,000 New Corp will be incurring commissions expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000. However, the payment will actually occur on January 10.

In the U.S. accounting textbooks, an uncleared cheque is referred to as an outstanding check. In the bank reconciliation process an uncleared cheque (or outstanding check) is deducted from the balance shown on the bank statement to arrive at the correct or adjusted balance per bank.", "Example of Uncleared Cheque": "On December 28, a company records and mails a check for $8,120 to one of its suppliers in another region of the country. As of December 31, the check has not yet cleared the company\u2019s checking account. Therefore, this $8,120 check is an uncleared cheque or an outstanding check. ", "Definition of Reversal of Accrued Expense": "An accrued expense typically requires an accrual adjusting entry recorded at the end of an accounting year (or any other accounting period). The accrual adjusting entry is needed to get the expense reported on the income statement for the period when the expense was incurred and as a current liability on the end-of-the-year balance sheet. After the financial statements are distributed the adjusting entry can be permanently removed. On the first day in the next accounting period, a reversing entry will be recorded to permanently remove the accrued amounts because the actual  invoice for the accrued expense will be received and processed. The reversing entry assures that the expense will be reported once on the company\u2019s financial statements.", "Example of Reversal of Accrued Expense": "Assume that a company incurred $10,000 of interest expense that has not yet been recorded as of December 31 (the final day of the accounting year). Therefore, a December 31 accrual adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense with this additional $10,000 and will credit Accrued Interest Payable. This will get the proper amounts on the company\u2019s income statement and balance sheet. The account Interest Expense will begin January with a zero balance, since expenses are temporary accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting year. On January 2, a reversing entry is recorded which removes the $10,000 liability and causes a $10,000 credit balance in Interest Expense. The negative amount in Interest Expense will disappear when the actual interest expense is recorded in January.", "Definition of Bookkeeping Equation": "The bookkeeping equation (or accounting equation) is similar to the structure of the balance sheet:", "Example of Bookkeeping Equation": "Assume that Sara Jones starts a sole proprietorship, SJCO, by depositing $900 in a new business checking account. The bookkeeping equation will show the following: Assets of $900 = Owner\u2019s Equity of $900. In words, the equation indicates that SJCO has resources of $900 and that the owner has the only claim to its resources. The equation also indicates that the resources of $900 were provided by the owner. Next, assume that SJCO incurs advertising expense of $250, but the bill will be paid 10 days later. Since owner\u2019s equity is reduced by expenses (and is increased by revenues), the bookkeeping equation will show the following: Assets of $900 = Liabilities of $250 + Owner\u2019s Equity of $650. After the advertising bill is paid, the bookkeeping equation will show these amounts: Assets of $650 = Owner\u2019s Equity of $650.

However, there are two noteworthy differences:", "Examples of Income Statements of Sole Proprietorship and Regular Corporation": "Assume that both a sole proprietorship and a regular corporation had revenues and gains of $350,000 and expenses and losses of $200,000 (not counting any compensation for the owner). In addition, the stockholder working in the corporation earns a salary of $80,000. The owner of the sole proprietor works as hard, but instead of a salary, draws $80,000 for personal use. The regular corporation pays a $10,000 cash dividend and its income tax rate is 15%. The income statement of the sole proprietorship will report net income of $160,000 ($360,000 \u2013 $200,000). The corporation\u2019s income statement will report net before income tax of $80,000 ($360,000 \u2013 $280,000) and net income after tax of $68,000 ($80,000 \u2013 $12,000). As a result of these two differences, the net income (which is the bottom line of the income statements) will be different. In the case of the sole proprietorship, the net income is the total amount that the owner has earned before income taxes for 1) the capital invested in the business and 2) the owner\u2019s compensation for working in the business. In the case of a regular corporation owned by one person, the owner has earned the salary (which was included in salary expense on the income statement) and has also earned the reported amount of net income or net loss. Neither the draws made by the sole proprietor nor the dividends distributed by a regular corporation are reported on the income statement.", "Definition of Adjusting Prepaid Expenses": "The balance in the current asset account Prepaid Expenses should be adjusted prior to a company issuing its financial statements.  If the company issues financial statements at the end of each calendar month, the balance in the account Prepaid Expenses must be adjusted so that the balance sheet reports the amount that is actually prepaid (not yet expired) at the end of the month. If the company issues only quarterly financial statements, the account balance in Prepaid Expenses must report the actual amount that is actually prepaid (not yet expired) at the end of the quarter.", "Example of Adjusting Prepaid Expenses": "Assume that a company\u2019s only prepaid expense is the prepaid premiums on its liability insurance policy. Also assume that on December 1, the company paid $6,000 for the  insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31. The company recorded the December 1 payment with a debit of $6,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $6,000 to Cash. On December 31, the account Prepaid Expenses must be adjusted to report a balance of $5,000 since the amount prepaid is decreasing by $1,000 a month. Therefore, an adjusting entry must be recorded as of December 31 to credit Prepaid Expenses for $1,000 and to debit Insurance Expense for $1,000. The same adjusting entry must be recorded as of the last day of January, February, March, April, and May.

When the principal payment is made, the borrower\u2019s liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable is decreased and the bank\u2019s asset Notes Receivable or Loans Receivable is decreased.", "Definition of Nonmanufacturing Overhead Costs": "Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the business expenses that are outside of a company\u2019s manufacturing operations. In other words, these costs are not part of a manufacturer\u2019s product cost or its production costs (which are direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead). Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the company\u2019s selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plus the company\u2019s interest expense. Since nonmanufacturing overhead costs are outside of the manufacturing function, these nonmanufacturing costs are immediately expensed in the accounting period in which they are incurred. That is why accountants refer to nonmanufacturing costs as period costs or period expenses. ", "Examples of Nonmanufacturing Overhead Costs": "Examples of the nonmanufacturing overhead costs include the salaries and other expenses for the following business activities: selling, distribution, marketing, finance, accounting, IT, human resources, legal, and so on. (We have additional examples within our AccountingCoach.com topic Nonmanufacturing Overhead.) While the nonmanufacturing overhead costs are not allocated to the products, the company must have its selling prices and sales revenues sufficiently large to cover both the product costs and the period expenses to have a positive amount of net income.", "Definition of Accelerated Depreciation": "Accelerated depreciation means the cost of an asset used in a business will be charged to Depreciation Expense at a faster rate than straight-line depreciation. However, the total amount of depreciation expense over the life of the asset cannot exceed the asset\u2019s cost regardless of the depreciation method. In other words, the difference between accelerated depreciation and straight-line depreciation is a \u201ctiming difference.\u201d In the U.S., a business is allowed to use straight-line depreciation on its financial statements and at the same time use accelerated depreciation on its income tax returns.  Using accelerated depreciation on its U.S. income tax returns will mean greater depreciation expense and smaller taxable income in the earlier years of an asset\u2019s life. However, it will be followed by smaller depreciation expense and greater taxable income in the later years of the asset\u2019s life. Therefore, a corporation with consistent taxable income will be able to defer some income taxes until the later years of the asset\u2019s life. This is especially attractive because of the time value of money.", "Examples of Accelerated Depreciation Methods": "Three examples of accelerated depreciation methods include the following:", "Use of Accelerated Depreciation for Income Tax Reporting": "The U.S. income tax regulations allow a business to use accelerated depreciation on its income tax return while using straight-line depreciation on its financial statements.

However, the check will not clear Payer Corporation\u2019s checking account until Monday. Hence, Payer Corporation will have $5,000 of float between Wednesday and Monday. Mary plays the float when she mails her rent check on Thursday even though she does not have a sufficient balance in her personal checking account. She is counting on her paycheck being electronically deposited on Monday morning prior to her rent check clearing her checking account. Float is associated with the outstanding checks shown on the bank reconciliation.", "Definition of Mortgage Loan": "A mortgage loan is a loan associated with the purchase of real estate, such as a home or buildings used in a business. As part of the loan process, the lender files a mortgage with the county where the property is located. The mortgage provides a lien on the property that protects the lender if the borrower fails to pay the amounts owed.", "Example of a Mortgage Loan": "Typically, mortgage loans are long-term loans requiring monthly payments of interest and principal. For example, assume that a company wants to buy a vacant warehouse for $500,000. The company\u2019s banker agrees to lend the company $350,000 in the form of a 5-year mortgage loan with monthly payments of interest and principal. The mortgage filed with the county where the warehouse is located shows that the bank has the first claim on the property for any principal and interest owed by the borrower.

The objective of the income statement is to report how profitable a company was during a time interval (period of time), such as a year, quarter, month, 52 weeks, etc. Costs that occurred but are not yet expensed on the income statement are typically referred to as deferred costs, deferred expenses, or prepaid expenses and are reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet as current assets until they become an expense.", "Examples of Deferred Expenses": "Assume that a company pays $3,000 on December 30 to rent a warehouse for the upcoming three-month period of January 1 through March 31. Since none of the $3,000 expired or was used up in December, the entire $3,000 is deferred to the balance sheet account Prepaid Rent (or Prepaid Expenses,) which is a current asset.  During the three months of January 1 through March 31 (when the prepaid rent is expiring) the $3,000 prepayment must be moved from the balance sheet asset account to an income statement expense account. If the company issues monthly income statements, the company will prepare adjusting entries to move $1,000 each month from the Prepaid Rent account to Rent Expense. When a retailer purchases goods to be resold, the cost of the goods purchased, but not yet sold, will be deferred to the current asset account Inventory. When goods are sold, the retailer moves the cost of those goods from Inventory to the income statement as the  Cost of Goods Sold, which is an expense that is being matched with the related sales revenues.", "Definition of a Lease": "Typically, a lease is a written agreement between an owner of property (land, building, equipment, vehicle, etc.) and a person or business that will use the property for a stated period of time in exchange for a specified series of payments.

Some leases are for short periods of time with no intention of transferring ownership of the asset in exchange for the rent payments. Other leases may be for longer periods with the ownership of the asset transferring to the lessee for a small additional payment.", "Examples of Leases": "A person or business might lease a suite in a large building for a one-year period. The lease agreement states that the lessee will pay the lessor $1,200 per month. Clearly, the lessor (property owner) is not agreeing to transfer ownership of the unit to the lessee (tenant) at the end of the one-year lease. Another lease might involve a business leasing a forklift from a forklift dealer. This lease states that it is noncancelable and requires 60 monthly payments of $600 per month. After the 60th monthly payment, the business (lessee) may take ownership of the forklift truck by paying the forklift dealer (lessor) an additional $500.", "Types of Adjusting Entries": "Adjusting entries, which are required in order to have a company\u2019s financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting, are often categorized into three types:", "Accruals": "Accruals or accrual adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to report amounts that have occurred in the current accounting period but were not yet entered into the general ledger accounts. An example is a retail store\u2019s emergency plumbing repair on December 31, the last day of its accounting period. The repair occurred in the December accounting period but the bill will not be received until the January accounting period. As of December 31, the retailer needs an accrual adjusting entry so that its December financial statements will report the expense and the liability. Also on December 31, the plumbing company will need an accrual adjusting entry so that its financial statements will report the revenues and the receivables that were earned in December.", "Deferrals": "Deferrals or deferral adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to defer expenses and/or revenues that have already been recorded in the general ledger accounts. The reason is that some of the recorded amounts will actually be used up and/or earned in a future accounting period. An example is a retailer\u2019s payment of $1,200 for six months of property insurance that was paid in advance. For instance, if the payment was made on December 1 for protection during the upcoming period of December 1 through May 31, the retailer\u2019s December\u2019s income statement should report Insurance Expense of $200 (the expired 1/6 of the $1,200) and the December 31 balance sheet should report Prepaid Insurance of $1,000 (a current asset that represents the unexpired 5/6 of $1,200). The amount used in the deferral adjusting entry should be whatever is necessary to get the proper amounts to appear on the financial statements. The insurance company must also make a deferral adjusting entry so that its December revenues will include only the $200 that was earned. Its December 31 balance sheet should show the unearned $1,000 as the current liability Deferred Premiums.", "Other": "Other adjusting entries will likely include:", "Definition of Net Method": "In accounting, the net method likely refers to the way a company records each vendor\u2019s invoice that offers an early payment discount.", "Example of Net Method": "Assume that a company purchased $1,000 of goods on credit. The vendor\u2019s invoice shows the amount of $1,000 along with credit terms of 2/10, net 30 days. This means the $1,000 is due within 30 days, but if the company pays the invoice within 10 days, only $980 needs to be paid. ($980 is the \u201cnet\u201d of the $1,000 invoice amount minus the early payment discount of $20, which is 2% of $1,000.) Companies that use the net method will record the vendor\u2019s invoice as follows: credit Accounts Payable for $980 and debit another account (Inventory, Purchases, etc.) for $980.  If the company\u2019s policy is to pay all vendor invoices within the discount period, the net method will result in a more precise current liability amount on its balance sheet. It also means that the accounts and amounts recorded as debits will better reflect the historical cost principle. If a company uses the net method, but fails to remit the net amount within the discount period, the net method requires a debit entry to the expense Purchase Discounts Lost. In our example, if the company pays the invoice in 30 days, it is not entitled to the early payment discount and will therefore have to credit Cash for $1,000. The debit amounts include Accounts Payable for $980 and Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Any amount recorded in Purchase Discounts Lost informs management that its policy of paying within the discount period has been violated. Although the net method is theoretically better, it seems to be less efficient than recording vendor invoices at their stated amounts.", "Definition of Aging of Accounts Receivable": "The aging of accounts receivable sorts the amounts that a company is owed (from customers who had purchased goods or services on credit) into columns with headings such as: current, 1-30 days past due, 31-60 days past due, etc. A receivable that is current (not past due) is usually not a problem. However, when customers are past due it is a sign that they are experiencing some financial difficulties. The greater the amount of time they are past due, the greater the possibility they will not pay the amount they owe the company. Good accounting requires the company to have an  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts to report a credit balance for the estimated amount of the accounts receivable that will not be collected. When a company needs to adjust the credit balance in the Allowance account to a larger amount, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for the amount necessary to have a sufficient credit balance. ", "Example of the Aging of Accounts Receivable and Bad Debts Expense": "Assume that a company has a debit balance in Accounts Receivable of $120,000 and has a credit balance of $1,000 in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This indicates that the net realizable value of its accounts receivable is $119,000. When reviewing an aging of the accounts receivable, the company discovers it has more past due customers and estimates that $8,000 of the accounts receivable will never be collected. Therefore, the company must increase the credit balance in the Allowance account by $7,000 with an accounting entry that debits Bad Debt Expense for $7,000 and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $7,000.

The reason is that the sales taxes included in the sales invoices are not revenues earned by the seller. Instead, the sales taxes are the state/local government\u2019s revenues. The seller is merely acting as an agent that is required to collect and remit the sales taxes to the government. As a result, the sales taxes included in a company\u2019s sales invoices are recorded in a current liability account such as Sales Taxes Payable. When the company remits the sales taxes to the state or local government, the balance in Sales Taxes Payable is reduced. Any unremitted balance in Sales Taxes Payable is reported in the current liability section of the company\u2019s balance sheet.", "Sales vs Net Sales": "Assume that a company has sales invoices for the month amounting to $63,000. The sales invoices represent the goods shipped to customers and includes $1,000 of sales taxes pertaining to its retail customers.

The company also granted allowances of $200 to customers who received damaged goods or had been given a price adjustment. Given the above information, the company\u2019s sales are calculated as follows:\nSales invoices with a total of $63,000 minus $1,000 of sales taxes that were included as required by the state/local government = the company\u2019s sales of $62,000. Sales are also referred to as gross sales.

When the revenues are earned but cash is not received, the asset accounts receivable will be recorded. (Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues are not reported on the income statement until the cash is received.) Also under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are reported on the income statement when they match up with the revenues being reported, or when a cost has no future benefit that can be measured. When an expense occurs and cash has not yet been paid, a liability account will also be recorded. (The expenses that were not paid in the current accounting period will be reported through adjusting entries.) In other words, under the accrual basis of accounting, the receipt of cash and the payment of cash are not the focus of reporting revenues and expenses. Rather the focus is: 1) what revenues were earned, and 2) what expenses were incurred. Therefore, the accrual basis of accounting provides a more accurate measure of a company\u2019s profitability during an accounting period, and a more accurate picture of a company\u2019s assets and liabilities at the end of an accounting period.", "Example of Reporting Revenues Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting": "Let\u2019s assume that I begin an accounting business in December and during December I provided $10,000 of accounting services. Since I allow clients to pay in 30 days, none of the $10,000 of fees that I earned in December were received in December. Rather, my clients paid the $10,000 in January. Under the accrual basis of accounting my business will report the $10,000 of revenues I earned on the December income statement and will report accounts receivable of $10,000 on the December 31 balance sheet.", "Example of Reporting Expenses Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting": "Now let\u2019s assume that I paid office rent of $1,500 and incurred $300 of costs for electricity, gas, and sewer/water during December. However, the utilities will not read the meters until January 1, will bill me on January 10 and require that I pay the bill by February 1. Under the accrual basis of accounting I will report the rent expense in December because the rent was used up in December, and I will also report estimated utilities expense of $300 so that the December income statement provides a better measure of December\u2019s profitability. Also the December 31 balance sheet will report a liability such as utilities payable of $300 to communicate a more accurate measure of obligations at December 31.", "Comparing Accrual Basis to Cash Basis": "Using the transactions above, the accrual basis of accounting will result in the December income statement reporting revenues of $10,000 and expenses of $1,800 for a net income of $8,200. Using the cash basis of accounting the December income statement will report $0 revenues and expenses of $1,500 for a net loss of $1,500 even though I had earned $10,000 in accounting fees. Further, the balance sheet will not report the obligation for the utilities that were used. The January income statement will report the collection of the fees earned in December, and the February income statement will report the expense of using the December utilities. Hence, the cash basis of accounting can be misleading to the readers of the financial statements. For financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.", "Definition of Capital Expenditure": "A capital expenditure is an amount spent to acquire or significantly improve the capacity or capabilities of a long-term asset such as equipment or buildings. Usually the cost is recorded in a balance sheet account that is reported under the heading of Property, Plant and Equipment. The asset\u2019s cost (except for the cost of land) will then be allocated to depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset.

", "Definition of Matching Principle": "The matching principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. The matching principle directs a company to report an expense on its income statement in the period in which the related revenues are earned. Further, it results in a liability to appear on the balance sheet for the end of the accounting period. The matching principle is associated with the accrual basis of accounting and adjusting entries. If an expense is not directly tied to revenues, the expense should be reported on the income statement in the accounting period in which it expires or is used up. If the future benefit of a cost cannot be determined, it should be charged to expense immediately.", "Examples of the Matching Principle": "To illustrate the matching principle, let\u2019s assume that a company\u2019s sales are made entirely through sales representatives (reps) who earn a 10% commission. The commissions are paid on the 15th day of the month following the calendar month of the sales. For instance, if the company has $60,000 of sales in December, the company will pay commissions of $6,000 on January 15. The matching principle requires that $6,000 of commissions expense be reported on the December income statement along with the related December sales of $60,000. It also requires that the December 31 balance sheet report a current liability of $6,000. This is referred to as an accrual and is achieved through an adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Commissions Expense for $6,000 and credits Commissions Payable for $6,000. (Without the matching principle and the adjusting entry, the company might report the $6,000 of commissions expense in January rather than in December when the expense and the liability were incurred.) A retailer\u2019s or a manufacturer\u2019s cost of goods sold is another example of an expense that is matched with sales through a cause and effect relationship. Not all costs and expenses have a cause and effect relationship with revenues. Hence, the matching principle may require a systematic allocation of a cost to the accounting periods in which the cost is used up. Hence, if a company purchases an elaborate office system for $252,000 that will be useful for 84 months, the company should report $3,000 of depreciation expense on each of its monthly income statements. If the future benefit of a cost cannot be determined, it should be charged to expense immediately. For example, the entire cost of a television advertisement that is shown during the Olympics will be charged to advertising expense in the year that the ad is shown.", "Definition of Double Declining Balance Method of Depreciation": "The double declining balance method of depreciation,\u00a0also known as the 200% declining balance method of depreciation, is a  form of accelerated depreciation. This means that compared to the straight-line method, the depreciation expense will be faster in the early years of the asset\u2019s life but slower in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation expense during the life of the assets will be the same.  The \u201cdouble\u201d means 200% of the straight line rate of depreciation, while the \u201cdeclining balance\u201d refers to the asset\u2019s book value or carrying value at the beginning of the accounting period. Since book value is an asset\u2019s cost minus its accumulated depreciation, the asset\u2019s book value will be\u00a0decreasing when the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is\u00a0credited with the depreciation expense of the accounting period.", "Example of Double Declining Balance Depreciation": "Let\u2019s\u00a0assume that a retailer purchases fixtures on January 1 at a cost of $100,000. It is expected that the fixtures will have no salvage value at the end of their useful life of 10\u00a0years.\u00a0Under the straight-line method, the 10-year life\u00a0means\u00a0the asset\u2019s annual depreciation\u00a0will be 10% of the asset\u2019s cost. Under the\u00a0double declining balance method the 10% straight line rate is doubled to 20%. However, the 20% is multiplied times the fixture\u2019s book value at the beginning of the year instead of the fixture\u2019s original cost. At the beginning of the\u00a0first year, the fixture\u2019s book value is $100,000 since the fixtures have not yet had any depreciation. Therefore,\u00a0under the\u00a0double declining balance method the $100,000 of book value will be multiplied\u00a0by 20% and will result in $20,000 of depreciation for Year 1.\u00a0The journal entry will be a debit of\u00a0$20,000 to Depreciation Expense and a credit of $20,000 to Accumulated Depreciation. At the beginning of the second year, the fixture\u2019s book value will be $80,000, which is the cost of $100,000 minus the accumulated depreciation of $20,000. When the $80,000 is multiplied by 20% the result is $16,000 of depreciation for Year 2. At the beginning of Year 3, the asset\u2019s book value will be $64,000. This is the fixture\u2019s cost of $100,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $36,000 ($20,000 + $16,000). The book value of $64,000 multiplied by 20% is $12,800 of depreciation expense for Year 3. At the beginning of Year 4, the\u00a0asset\u2019s book value will be $51,200. Therefore, the book value of $51,200 multiplied by 20% will result in $10,240 of depreciation expense for Year 4. At the beginning of Year 5, the asset\u2019s book value will be $40,960. This is the amount to be depreciated over the remaining 6 years.

However, the amount of goodwill is subject to a goodwill impairment test at least once per year. (Beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.)

Let\u2019s also assume that the company has only one full-time employee who began working at the company on January 1 of the current year and has an hourly pay rate of $26. In the current year, this employee will earn vacation pay of $3,120 (120 hours x $26), or $60 per week ($3,120 per year divided by 52 weeks). This means that in the current year the company must record vacation pay expense and a related liability at a rate of $60 per week. In our example, the company has only the one full-time employee, so the company\u2019s December 31 balance sheet must report a current liability of $3,120. Vacation pay is an example of an accrued expense and an accrued liability that is required by the matching principle.", "Definition of the Write-off of a Bad Account": "The write-off of a bad account usually refers to eliminating an account receivable due to the customer\u2019s inability to pay the amount owed. The entry to write off a bad account depends on whether the company is using the direct write-off method or the allowance method.", "Examples of the Write-off of a Bad Account": "Under the direct write-off method a company writes off a bad account receivable when a specific account is determined to be uncollectible. This usually occurs many months after the credit sale occurred. The entry to write off the bad account under the direct write-off method is:", "Definition of Long-term Liability": "A long-term liability is an obligation resulting from a previous event that is not due within one year of the date of the balance sheet (or not due within the company\u2019s operating cycle if it is longer than one year). Long-term liabilities are also known as noncurrent liabilities.", "Examples of Long-term Liabilities": "Some examples of long-term liabilities are the noncurrent portions of the following:", "Example of Working Capital": "Assume that a company\u2019s balance sheet of December 31 reports current assets of $450,000 and current liabilities of $320,000. The working capital at the final instant of December 31 is $130,000 ($450,000 \u2013 $320,000). Even with a significant amount of working capital, a company can experience a cash shortage if its current assets are not turning to cash. For example, if a company has most of its current assets in the form of inventory and sales slow and customers take more time to pay the amounts they owe, the company may not have the cash needed to meet its payroll or to pay other current liabilities when they come due. It is important for a company to monitor all of its current assets so that the cash keeps flowing into the company\u2019s checking account.", "Additional Comments on Working Capital": "The adequacy of a company\u2019s working capital depends on the industry in which it competes, its relationship with its customers and suppliers, and other factors such as the following:", "Definition of Impairment": "The term impairment is associated with an asset currently having a market value that is less than the asset\u2019s book value . A test is done to determine whether the asset\u2019s book value should be reduced to the current market value and to report the amount of the write-down (reduction) as a loss on its income statement.", "Examples of Impairment": "A meat packing plant in recent years invested large amounts in its plant and equipment. Since then, the company experienced a dramatic decline in the demand for its products and in the value of its plant and equipment. If the required test of impairment indicates that a loss must be recorded on its plant and equipment, its book value must be reduced and the resulting loss reported on its income statement. A second example is Corporation X that acquired another company. The amount paid for the company resulted in Corporation X reporting a large amount for the intangible asset goodwill. Since the acquisition, the acquired company\u2019s value has declined to only a small fraction of the amount currently reported as goodwill. A test must be done and it may require a reduction in the reported amount of goodwill and a resulting impairment loss reported on the company\u2019s income statement.", "Definition of Units of Production Depreciation": "The units of production method of depreciation (which is also referred to as the units of activity method) assumes that an asset\u2019s useful life is more related to its usage rather than the mere passage of time. Under the units of production method, depreciation during a given year will be greater when there is a higher volume of activity. In times of low usage the asset\u2019s depreciation will be less.", "Example of Calculating Units of Production Depreciation": "To illustrate the units of production method, let\u2019s assume that a company has a machine with a cost of $500,000 and a useful life that is expected to end after producing 240,000 units of a component part. Further, the machine\u2019s salvage value at that point is assumed to be $20,000. Given the above assumptions, the amount to be depreciated is $480,000 ($500,000 minus $20,000). Dividing the $480,000 by the machine\u2019s useful life of 240,000 units, the depreciation will be $2 per unit. If the machine produces 10,000 units in the first year, the depreciation for the year will be $20,000 ($2 x 10,000 units). If the machine produces 50,000 units in the next year, the depreciation will be $100,000 ($2 x 50,000 units). The depreciation will be calculated similarly each year until the asset\u2019s  Accumulated Depreciation reaches $480,000.

Rather, it will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. A loss contingency that is probable or possible but the amount cannot be estimated means the amount cannot be recorded in the company\u2019s accounts or reported as liability on the balance sheet.

If the loan costs are significant, they must be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan because of the matching principle.", "Example of Amortizing Loan Costs": "Assume that a company incurs loan costs of $120,000 during February in order to obtain a $4 million loan at an annual interest rate of 9%. The loan will begin on March 1 and the entire $4 million of principal will be due five years later. In addition to the one-time loan costs of $120,000 the company will also have the cost of the borrowed money which is $360,000 ($4 million X 9%) of interest each year for five years. It would be misleading to report the entire $120,000 of loan costs as an expense for the month of February. Hence, the matching principle requires that each month during the life of the loan the company should report $2,000 ($120,000 divided by 60 months) of loan costs as interest expense in addition to the interest expense of $30,000 per month ($4 million X 9% per year = $360,000 per year divided by 12 months per year). The combination of the monthly amortization of $2,000 and the monthly interest expense of $30,000 results in total monthly interest expense of $32,000 for each of the 60 months beginning on March 1. When the note is issued and the loan costs are incurred, the company will debit a liability account such as Deferred Debt Issuance Costs for $120,000. This account balance is presented along with the $4,000,000 credit balance in Notes Payable. The result will be an initial net long-term liability of $3,880,00 and a net cash increase of $3,880,000. Each month the company will amortize the debt issue costs by crediting Deferred Debt Issue Costs for $2,000 and debiting Interest Expense for $2,000.", "Definition of Goods in Transit": "Goods in transit refers to inventory items and other products that have been shipped by a seller, but have not yet reached the purchaser. When goods are in transit at the end of an accounting period, they require special accounting attention since the goods are not physically present at either the seller\u2019s or the buyer\u2019s location.

The company ships a truckload of merchandise on December 30 to a customer who is located 2,000 miles away.  The merchandise arrives at the customer\u2019s location on January 2. Between December 30 and January 2, the merchandise is an example of goods in transit.  If the terms are FOB shipping point, the company (seller) will record a sale and receivable as of December 30, and will not include the goods in transit as its December 31 inventory. On December 31, the customer (buyer) is the owner of the goods in transit and will need to report a purchase, a payable, and must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory cost. If the terms of the sale are FOB destination, the company (seller) will not have a sale and receivable until January 2. This means the company (seller) must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory as of December 31.

Its bank is lending the company $320,000 at an annual interest rate of 6% to cover 80% of the building addition\u2019s cost. The remaining 20% will be paid from the company\u2019s present cash balance. Also assume that the company\u2019s building materials, labor and overhead will amount to $400,000 during the three months of construction. The capitalized interest is based on the 6% loan of $320,000 and the accumulated construction expenditures during the three-month construction period. The maximum amount of capitalized interest will be $320,000 X 6% X 3/12 = $4,800.

Construction Work-in-Progress is often reported as the last line within the balance sheet classification Property, Plant and Equipment. There is no depreciation of the accumulated costs until the project is completed and the asset is placed into service.

The appraisal at the time of the purchase indicates that the land has a market value of $50,000 and the building has a market value of $200,000\u2026for a total market value of $250,000. In other words, the appraisal indicates that the land is 20% ($50,000/$250,000) of the market value, and the building is 80% ($200,000/$250,000) of the market value. The cost principle requires that the purchase be recorded at its cost of $220,000. However, we can use the appraisal amounts as a logical way to divide up the cost of $220,000 between land and building. Here is one approach:", "Definition of Contingent Asset": "A contingent asset is a potential asset that is associated with a\u00a0potential gain. The asset and gain are contingent because they are dependent upon some future event occurring or not occurring. Because of the concept of conservatism, a contingent asset and gain will not be recorded in a general ledger account or reported on the financial statements until they are certain.

During December the retailer will have incurred the cost of the electricity it used during December. Under the accrual basis of accounting the retailer must report a current liability on December 31 for the amount owed to the utility for the electricity it used to that point. On its income statement for December, the retailer must also report electricity expense for the cost of the electricity that it used during December. This may require the retailer to record an accrual adjusting entries with an estimated amount (if the electricity bill is not received in time).", "Definition of Cost Flow Assumptions": "The term cost flow assumptions refers to the manner in which costs are removed from a company\u2019s inventory and are reported as the cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average. (If specific identification is used, there is no need to make an assumption.) FIFO, LIFO, average are assumptions because the flow of costs out of inventory does not have to match the way the items were physically removed from inventory.", "Example of Cost Flow Assumptions": "To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that a company has four units of the same product in its inventory. The units were purchased at increasing costs and in the following sequence: $40, $41, $43, and $44.

This allows the readers of the financial statements to make meaningful comparisons between years. Consistency does allow a company to make a change to a more preferred accounting method. However, the change and its effects must be clearly disclosed for the benefit of the readers of the financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board refers to consistency as one of the characteristics or qualities that makes accounting information useful.", "Example of Consistency": "Let\u2019s assume that a U.S. corporation uses the FIFO cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and determining its cost of goods sold. Due to the increasing cost of its materials, it concludes that LIFO will better indicate the company\u2019s true profit. In the year of the change from FIFO to LIFO (and in years when comparisons are presented), the company must disclose the break in consistency. ", "Definition of Monetary Unit Assumption": "The monetary unit assumption as it applies to a U.S. corporation is that the U.S.dollar (USD) is stable in the long run. That is, the USD does not lose its purchasing power. Note that this is the assumption. As a result of the monetary unit assumption, accountants at a U.S. corporation do not hesitate to add the cost of a parcel of land purchased in 2024 to the cost of another parcel of land that had been purchased in 2004. (See example below.) Another part of the monetary unit assumption is that U.S. accountants report a corporation\u2019s assets as dollar amounts (rather than reporting details of all of the assets). If an asset cannot be expressed as a dollar amount, it cannot be entered in a general ledger account. For example, the management team of a very successful corporation may be the corporation\u2019s most valuable asset. However, the accountant is not able to objectively convert those talented people into USDs. Hence, the management team will not be included in the reported amounts on the balance sheet.", "Example of Monetary Unit Assumption": "Let\u2019s illustrate the monetary unit assumption with a hypothetical example. Assume that a U.S. corporation purchased a two-acre parcel of land at a cost of $80,000 in 2004. Then in 2024 the corporation purchased an adjacent (nearly identical) two-acre parcel at a cost of $500,000. After the 2024 purchase is recorded, the balance in the corporation\u2019s general ledger account Land is $580,000. Therefore, the corporation\u2019s balance sheet will report its four acres of land at a cost of $580,000. There is no adjustment for the difference in purchasing power between the 2004 dollar and the 2024 dollar.", "Definition of Notes to Financial Statements": "The notes to the financial statements are a required, integral part of a company\u2019s external financial statements.

The accounting rule requires inventory to be reported at the lower of its cost or its net realizable value (NRV). The amount of the inventory write-down is reported on the current income statement.  To illustrate, assume that a company has inventory with a cost of $15,000. However, the market for the goods has declined. As a result, the goods in inventory can be sold for $14,000, but only if the company spends an additional $2,000 to package and ship the goods.

This assessed value is used in determining the amount of property tax that the property owner will be assessed and will owe.", "Example of Assessed Value": "Assume that a company\u2019s warehouse is located in a city. The city tax assessor is responsible for determining the assessed value for every parcel of land and every building within the city.

The assessed values of real estate or personal property are not necessarily equal to the property\u2019s current market value.", "Definition of Appraised Value": "Appraised value is the amount (or amounts) contained in an appraisal report for a specific property. The appraisal report is generally prepared by a professional appraiser who looks at the property\u2019s features including size, type of construction, location, condition, and recent sales of comparable property in the vicinity. The appraised value is an attempt to determine the property\u2019s current market value. The appraisal report for real estate will usually report the appraised value of the land separate from the appraised value of the structures. An accountant might use the relationship of these appraised values to allocate the cost of real estate into the cost of the land and the cost of the buildings.", "Example of Appraised Value": "Appraised values are useful because a company\u2019s balance sheet will report its land and buildings at the cost when they were acquired and will report the accumulated depreciation of the buildings.

The cost may vary somewhat since U.S. companies may choose between the periodic inventory system and the perpetual inventory system. In addition, these companies may select from several cost flow assumptions, including FIFO, LIFO, average, etc.  While reporting at cost is the general rule, inventories must be reported at less than cost in certain situations. For example, some inventories will have to be reported at their net realizable value when it is less than cost.

As a result, the older costs remain in inventory.", "Example of LIFO": "Assume that a corporation uses LIFO and has three units of a product in its inventory. Due to its supplier raising its prices, the corporation purchased the items at different costs and in the following sequence: $40, $44, and $46. The corporation ships the oldest item (the one purchased for $40) to a customer at a selling price of $60. However, under the LIFO cost flow assumption the company reports its cost of goods sold at $46 (the latest cost) and reports a gross profit of $14. (The costs of $40 and $44 remain in inventory.)  Had the corporation used FIFO, it would have removed $40 from inventory and matched it with the selling price of $60. The result would have been a gross profit of $20 (instead of $14 using LIFO). As a result, LIFO allowed the corporation to avoid paying income tax on the additional $6.", "Definition of Trademark": "In the U.S. a trademark could be a word, phrase, logo, etc. registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. If a company purchases a trademark from another company, the amount paid for the trademark is recorded in a general ledger intangible asset account. If a company designs and registers its trademark, the amount recorded is limited to its cost. Costs incurred to defend a trademark are also recorded in the trademark account.  The cost of a trademark may have been very small, but over time has become very valuable. (Think Apple, Coke, Nike, etc.) Due to the cost principle, the balance sheet may be reporting trademarks at close to $0.", "Examples of Trademarks on the Balance Sheet": "Assume that Company X, a consumer products company, introduced a new product in 2004. It registered the trademark in 2004 for a small fee that was immediately expensed. Since then Company X has been very effective in promoting this trademarked brand. Consumers now pay a premium price for this recognized and superior product. A competitor offers to purchase the trademark from Company X for $100 million in cash. If Company X does not sell the trademark, Company X will not list the trademark as an asset. (Recall that the trademark\u2019s cost was $0.) If Company X were to sell the trademark to Company Y for $100 million, Company Y will report the trademark on its next balance sheet at $100 million. The reason is there was a transaction for $100 million and Company Y\u2019s cost of the trademark was $100 million.", "Definition of Allowance Method": "The allowance method usually refers to one of the two ways for reporting bad debts expense that results from a company selling goods or services on credit. (The other way is the direct write-off method.) Under the allowance method, a company records an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period for the amount of the losses it anticipates as the result of extending credit to its customers. The entry will involve the operating expense account Bad Debts Expense and the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Later, when a specific account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible, the company debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable. The allowance method is preferred over the direct write-off method because:", "Examples of Allowance Method": "Let\u2019s assume that a corporation begins operations on November 1 in an industry where it is common to give credit terms of net 30 days. In this industry approximately 0.3% of credit sales will not be collected. Next, let\u2019s assume that the corporation focuses on the bad debts expense. If the corporation\u2019s actual credit sales for November are $800,000 it will record an adjusting entry dated November 30 to debit Bad Debts Expense for $2,400 ($800,000 X 0.003) and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $2,400. As a result, its November income statement will be matching $2,400 of bad debts expense with the credit sales of $800,000. If the balance in Accounts Receivable is $800,000 as of November 30, the corporation will report Accounts Receivable (net) of $797,600. Focusing on the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, the corporation will adjust the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts so that the combination of that credit balance and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will be equal to the amount that is expected to turn to cash. The expected amount will likely be determined by aging the accounts receivable. If the corporation prepares weekly financial statements, it might focus on the bad debts expense for its weekly financial statements, but at the end of each quarter focus on the allowance account.", "Definition of Fully Depreciated Asset": "A fully depreciated asset is a depreciable asset for which no additional depreciation expense will be recorded. In other words, the asset\u2019s accumulated depreciation is equal to the asset\u2019s cost (or to its estimated salvage value).", "Example of Reporting a Fully Depreciated Asset on the Balance Sheet": "A fully depreciated asset that continues to be used is reported at its cost in the Property, Plant and Equipment section of the balance sheet. The asset\u2019s accumulated depreciation continues to be included in the total accumulated depreciation amount that appears as a subtraction or negative amount in the Property, Plant and Equipment section.  The cost and accumulated depreciation will continue to be reported on the balance sheet until the asset is no longer in use. This usually occurs when the company sells or retires the asset. Fully depreciated assets and their resulting book value of zero (or its salvage value) reinforces accountants\u2019 position that depreciation is a process for allocating an asset\u2019s cost to expense; it is not a process for valuing the asset.", "Definition of Rounding Amounts on Financial Statements": "Rounding the amounts on a company\u2019s financial statements means dropping the less important digits in order to emphasize the most important digits. This allows the financial statements to be more attractive and easier to read especially when the amounts for each of two or three years must be shown. ", "Example of Rounding Amounts on Financial Statements": "Imagine looking at a company\u2019s income statement without rounded sales amounts for the most recent three years: $1,512,989.63\u2026\u2026$1,321,026.98\u2026\u2026$1,265,876.22. Now look at the amounts rounded to the nearest thousand: $1,513\u2026\u2026$1,321\u2026\u2026$1,266.\nAt the top of the financial statement you must also state \u201cIn Thousands\u201d. Not only are the amounts easier to read, it is easier for the reader to spot a trend. Mid-size companies are likely to round the round the financial statement amounts to the nearest thousand, while large corporations are likely to round to the nearest million. Rounding is acceptable because of the accountant\u2019s concept of materiality. That is, rounding is acceptable as long as the rounded amounts do not mislead a current or potential investor, lender, or other person making a decision with the amounts being reported.", "Definition of Relevance": "In accounting, the term relevance could mean one of the following:", "Examples of Relevance": "Assume that a company is deciding to replace equipment that has been in use for the past six years. In the decision, the original cost of the equipment and its carrying amount or book value does not have relevance (except in calculating a tax consequence). The reason is that any decision can never undo the past. The decision involves today and the future. Therefore, the relevant amounts for the decision include the cost of the new equipment and the revenues and cost savings that will result from purchasing and using the new equipment. Further, the costs that will remain the same with or without replacing the equipment are not relevant. Examples are the depreciation of the building, salaries of the company\u2019s management, etc. For a company\u2019s financial statements to have relevance they must be issued within several weeks after each accounting period ends. To achieve relevance, the financial statements will include some estimated amounts such as the accrual adjusting entries that are part of the accrual method of accounting.", "Definition of Reporting Expenses by Function": "Reporting expenses by function means to classify and report expenses according to the type of activity for which the expenses were incurred.", "Examples of Reporting Expenses by Function": "Manufacturers classify and report their expenses on their internal income statements by the following functions:", "Definition of Paying Accounts Payable": "Under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are recorded when they have occurred, not when they are paid. Therefore, if an amount involving an expense is recorded in the current liability Accounts Payable, the expense will be recorded as part of the entry. When the company pays the invoice, the balance in Accounts Payable is reduced and the balance in the company\u2019s Cash account is reduced. The payment does not affect the amount of expenses or net income.", "Example of Paying Accounts Payable": "Assume that on January 2 a company has some of its office equipment repaired. The cost of the repair is $300 and is to be paid by January 31. On January 4, the invoice for the repair is recorded with a $300 debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense\u2013Office Equipment and a $300 credit to Accounts Payable. On January 31, the company pays the invoice and debits Accounts Payable and credits Cash for $300. The January 31 payment affected two balance sheet accounts. No expense or other income statement account was affected.", "Definition of Straight-Line Depreciation": "Straight-line depreciation is the most common method of allocating the cost of a plant asset to expense in the accounting periods during which the asset is used. With the straight-line method of depreciation, each full accounting year will report the same amount of depreciation. The total amount of depreciation over the years of the asset\u2019s useful life will be the asset\u2019s cost minus any expected or assumed salvage value. In the U.S., a regular corporation may use the straight-line method of depreciation for its financial statements while at the same time be using one of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s faster depreciation methods on its federal income tax return.", "Example of Straight-Line Depreciation": "To illustrate straight-line depreciation, assume that a service business purchases equipment on the first day of an accounting year at a cost of $430,000. Further, the equipment is expected to be used in the business for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, the company expects to receive the salvage value of $30,000. In this example, the straight-line depreciation method results in each full accounting year reporting depreciation expense of $40,000 ($400,000 of depreciable cost divided by 10 years). If the asset is purchased in the middle of the accounting year, there will be $20,000 of depreciation expense in the first and the eleventh accounting years and $40,000 in each of the accounting years 2 through 10.", "Definition of Bonds Payable": "Bonds payable are formal, long-term obligations that promise to pay interest every six months and the principal amount on the date the bonds mature/come due. It is common for bonds to mature 10 or more years after the date they are issued.", "Example of Bonds Payable Maturing within One Year of the Balance Sheet Date": "Bonds that will be maturing within one year of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current liability but only if the issuer of the bonds must use a current asset or will create a current liability in order to pay the bondholders when the bonds mature. Note that the bonds maturing within one year of the balance sheet date can continue being reported as a long-term (noncurrent) liability right up to the maturity date if one of the following situations exist:", "Definition of Bond Issue Costs": "The costs associated with issuing bonds are debited to a contra liability account such as Bond Issue Costs. Over the life of the bonds, the issue costs must be systematically moved from the balance sheet to the income statement. (Accountants refer to this as amortizing the costs.)", "Example of Bond Issue Costs": "Assume that a corporation incurs $24,000 of bond issue costs (legal and accounting fees) to register its recently issued bonds that will mature in 10 years. The corporation records these fees by debiting Bond Issue Costs for $24,000 and crediting Cash for $24,000. Using straight-line amortization, each month the corporation will debit Interest Expense for $200 ($24,000 divided by 120 months) and credit Bond Issue Costs for $200. The purpose is to match the $24,000 of bond issue costs to the 120 monthly accounting periods that are benefiting from the bonds having been issued.", "Definition of Income Smoothing": "Income smoothing involves reducing the fluctuations in a corporation\u2019s earnings. The reductions in fluctuations can result from some legitimate business methods to fraudulent ones.", "Examples of Income Smoothing": "A corporation\u2019s employee bonus plan, a deferred profit sharing plan, and/or a charitable giving plan may require an expense of 25% of its pretax profits. In addition, a U.S. corporation might have a combined federal and state income tax rate of 25% on its incremental pretax profits. These examples will smooth the corporation\u2019s earnings by having larger expenses when earnings are larger, and less expenses when earnings are less. (Negative losses may even result in negative income tax expense.) In a year of low earnings, the corporation might eliminate jobs, defer maintenance projects, reduce research and development efforts, etc. Then when earnings are higher, the corporation will increase spending for personnel and get caught up on the maintenance it had put off. It is more likely that the term income smoothing is used to mean reporting misleading earnings, creative accounting, and aggressive interpretation of accounting principles and concepts. Perhaps a company increases its allowance for doubtful accounts with an increased bad debts expense only in the years with high profits. Then in a year with low profits, the company will reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts and greatly reduce bad debt expense. Perhaps a U.S. manufacturer using LIFO will deliberately reduce its inventory quantities in low profit years in order to liquidate the old LIFO layers containing low unit costs. Another manufacturer might increase its production when sales and profits are low in order for its income statement to report a lower amount of cost of goods sold. Smoothing income by abusing the leeway in accounting principles is unethical and does a disservice to the users of the financial statements. Accountants should follow the profession\u2019s basic guidelines including:", "Definition of Capitalize": "In accounting, the term capitalize refers to adding an amount to the balance sheet as an asset (as opposed to immediately reporting the amount as an expense on the income statement). ", "Definition of Depreciate": "The term depreciate refers to systematically moving part of the cost of a plant asset from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement.", "Example of Capitalize and Depreciate": "Assume a corporation is self-constructing a new building next to its existing building. The corporation borrows the money for the construction from its local bank. The accounting rules state that the interest incurred for self-constructing the building should be added to the cost of the building. (The FASB refers to this as the capitalization of interest.)  Once the building is put into service, the building\u2019s cost (including the capitalized interest) is depreciated over its useful life.", "Examples of Limitations of Balance Sheet": "Assume that a company developed an internet business that now attracts millions of visitors each day and has $10 million in annual revenues and $6 million in net income. Since the internet business was not purchased from another company and its cost to develop was not significant, the company\u2019s balance sheet will report only the business\u2019s cash, receivables and some related payables. The balance sheet will not report the business as an asset, even though the company received multiple offers to sell the internet business for $30 million. Similarly, the immensely talented designers and content writers employed at a highly profitable internet marketing firm are not reported as assets on the firm\u2019s balance sheet because of the cost principle. This is also true for the firm\u2019s brand names that resulted from effective marketing, highly satisfied service, and expertise in specialty services that are in great demand. Another limitation of the balance sheet involves a company\u2019s land and buildings in valuable locations that were acquired many years ago. For instance, the company\u2019s land is reported at an amount no greater than its cost. The company\u2019s buildings are reported at their cost minus the accumulated depreciation. As a result, the amounts reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet for its land and buildings are significantly lower than their current market values.", "Definition of Commitments and Contingencies": "Commitments and contingencies is a balance sheet line with no amount reported. The line generally appears between the liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity sections to direct a reader\u2019s attention to the disclosures included in the notes to the financial statements. Commitments are likely legal binding agreements for future transactions. If no amount is currently payable, there is no liability amount reported but readers must be informed of items that are significant in amount. Contingencies refer to potential or contingent liabilities and losses. These are reported in the notes to the financial statements (instead of a general ledger account) because the amount might not be determinable or the liability is possible but not probable. Generally, gain contingencies are not disclosed.", "Examples of Commitments and Contingencies": "A chain of retail stores may have signed five-year, noncancelable leases to rent retail space for $1 million per year. This significant commitment must be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if the $5 million pertains to future dates, there is no liability amount to be reported on the current balance sheet. Another example of a commitment is an electric utility\u2019s noncancelable contract to purchase 100 million tons of coal during the following 10 years. This significant commitment must also be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if none of the coal has been delivered as of the balance sheet date, the utility company will not report a liability amount. Companies will often have some contingent liabilities, which are not recorded in the general ledger because the liability and loss may or may not become a liability. Unless the liability/loss is remote, if the item is signicant, it must be disclosed. An example of a contingent liability is a company\u2019s guarantee of its key supplier\u2019s bank loan. No liability amount is reported on the company\u2019s balance sheet because the supplier\u2019s loan payments are current and the supplier is operating profitably. If the company is named in a lawsuit, but the loss and liability is possible, it should be disclosed in the company\u2019s notes to the financial statements. (If the loss is remote, it does not get disclosed. If the loss is probable and the amount can be estimated, it should be recorded in the accounts and the amount of the liability reported on the balance sheet.) ", "Definition of Double-Declining-Balance Depreciation": "The double-declining-balance method of depreciation is a form of accelerated depreciation. This means a greater percentage of depreciable asset\u2019s cost will be expensed in early years of the asset\u2019s life and therefore less in the later years (compared to equal amounts using straight-line depreciation).", "Use of Double-Declining-Balance on Financial Statements": "Generally, companies will not use the double-declining-balance method of depreciation on their financial statements. The reason is that it causes the company\u2019s net income in the early years of an asset\u2019s life to be lower than it would be under the straight-line method. One reason for using  double-declining-balance depreciation on the financial statements is to have a more consistent combination of depreciation expense and repairs and maintenance expense throughout the life of the asset. In other words, in the early years of the asset\u2019s life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are low, the depreciation expense will be high. In the later years of the asset\u2019s life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are high, the depreciation expense will be low. (While this seems logical, companies prefer to delay expenses and enjoy the higher net income in the early years of an asset\u2019s life.)", "Definition of Note Payable and Bond Payable": "For accounting purposes, a note payable and a bond payable have the following similarities:", "Example of Note Payable and Bond Payable": "Assume that a corporation recently borrowed $200,000 in the form of a note payable due in two years with interest of 8% per year paid quarterly. In addition, it recently issued a $2,000,000 6% bond payable due in 10 years with interest paid semiannually. Both the note payable and the bond payable are to be reported as long-term (noncurrent) liabilities on the corporation\u2019s balance sheet. Any interest that has accrued but was not paid as of the balance sheet date is to be reported as a current liability such as Accrued Expenses Payable. On the corporation\u2019s income statements, the interest that occurred (whether paid or not paid) during the period of the income statement will be reported as interest expense.", "Definition of Rotating Inventory Stock": "To rotate stock means to arrange the oldest units in inventory so they are sold before the newer units. The goal is to avoid losses due to getting close to (or past) the sell by dates, deterioration, obsolescence, etc.  Expressed another way, to rotate the stock of goods on hand means that the physical flow of goods will result in the first or oldest goods being sold first. However, the accounting cost flows do not have to agree with the physical flow of the goods. This means that a U.S. business can diligently rotate its inventory items, and at the same time use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost flow assumption. (In periods of inflation LIFO means the higher/recent costs will be  moved to the cost of goods sold while the older/lower costs remain in inventory. This can result in less taxable income and less income taxes.)", "Example of Rotating Inventory Stock": "A grocery store restocks its shelves by moving the oldest units to the front of the shelves and places the newest units in the back of the shelves. The hope is that the customer will select the most convenient (older) units from the front of the shelf. In order for a company to avoid losses, it is important that the stock of goods in all locations (retail display area, warehouses, factory, etc.) be rotated. When the grocery store rotates its stock, the units are physically flowing first-in, first-out (FIFO). However, in the accounting for the cost of inventory and the cost of the goods sold, a U.S. company is allowed to use a cost flow assumption which is different from the flow of the physical units.", "Definition of Interest Expense as a Nonoperating Expense": "Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money. For most companies the borrowing of money is not part of their main business activities. Most companies purchase or produce goods and sell them, or they provide services to clients, etc. The borrowing and lending of money is just an incidental or peripheral activity. Therefore, their interest expense is reported as a nonoperating expense on their income statements.", "Example of Interest Expense as a Nonoperating Expense": "Assume that prior to its holiday season, a retailer borrows $200,000 from its bank and promises to repay the bank in three months plus interest of $3,000. On each of the retailer\u2019s monthly income statements, it will report $1,000 of interest expense in the \u201cnonoperating\u201d or \u201cother\u201d section, which appears after the amount of operating income is shown. As a result, the income statement allows for an easy comparison of the operations and profitability of companies regardless of their debt and interest expense.", "Definition of Income Taxes Paid by a Corporation": "The amount of income tax paid by a corporation is different from the amount of income tax (income tax provision, income tax expense) that is reported on a regular corporation\u2019s income statement. US GAAP requires corporations to report/disclose the amount of income taxes paid (as well as the amount of interest paid).  ", "Example of Where the Income Taxes Paid is Reported": "The amount of income taxes paid by a corporation is typically shown at the bottom of the statement of cash flows or in the corporation\u2019s notes to the financial statements. For U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly-traded, you will find the statement of cash flows included in its Form 10-K, which is the annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).", "Definition of Asset\u2019s Useful Life": "An asset\u2019s useful life is the estimated period of time (or total amount of activity) that a long-lived asset will be economically feasible for use in a business. In other words, it is the expected number of years that the business asset will be in service for earning revenues. With technological advances, an asset\u2019s useful life will likely be shorter than its physical life.", "Example of an Asset\u2019s Useful Life": "Assume that a high tech company\u2019s cell phones are expected to have a useful life of three years (even though the physical life of the cell phones could be 10 years). Also assume that the company has purchased 100 smart phones at a total cost of $120,000. The company also estimates that the phones will have no salvage value at the end of the useful life. The company\u2019s straight-line depreciation will be $40,000 ($120,000 / 3 years). This allocation of the phones\u2019 cost to the accounting periods that benefit from the asset\u2019s use follows the accountant\u2019s matching principle. This makes the company\u2019s financial statements more realistic and in compliance with the accrual basis of accounting. Note: In the U.S., income tax regulations specify the useful life that must be used for income tax reporting. This is one reason that in a given year the depreciation on a company\u2019s income tax return will not agree with the depreciation reported on its financial statements.", "Definition of Depletion": "In accounting, depletion refers to the expensing of a company\u2019s cost of a natural resource. Ultimately, it means moving a natural resource\u2019s cost from the company\u2019s balance sheet to the company\u2019s income statements as the natural resource is being sold. The objective of depletion is to match the cost of the natural resources that were sold with the revenues  from the natural resources that were sold.  Conceptually, depletion is similar to the depreciation of property, plant and equipment.", "Examples of Depletion": "Examples of depletion involve the logical expensing of a company\u2019s cost of natural resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, metals, stone, etc.", "Definition of Time Value of Money": "The time value of money recognizes that receiving cash today is more valuable than receiving cash in the future. The reason is that the cash received today can be invested immediately and begin growing in value. For instance, if a company receives $1,000 today and is able to invest the amount immediately at a rate of 10% per year, the company will have $1,100 after 365 days. If the time value of money is 10%, it also means that receiving $1,100 in one year is comparable to receiving $1,000 today. Accountants will state that the future value of $1,100 has a present value of $1,000. The difference of $100 will be reported as interest income during the 365 days that the company is earning the interest.", "Example of the Time Value of Money": "Assume that a company provides consulting services today and agrees to receive $11,000 one year later. The $11,000 represents:", "Importance of the Time Value of Money in Accounting": "The time value of money is important in accounting because of the accountant\u2019s cost principle and revenue recognition principle.

For instance, between a company\u2019s balance sheet date of December 31, 2023 and the time that the  financial statements are distributed on January 31, 2024, it is possible a significant event occurs or information becomes known that is important to the users of the December 31 financial statements. The following are two types of events/information that require the accountant\u2019s consideration:", "Example of Events After Balance Sheet Date": "To illustrate the first situation, assume a customer owes a corporation $200,000 on December 31 and the corporation believed that the customer\u2019s receivable would be collected in full. (Therefore, the corporation did not have any allowance for doubtful accounts.) On January 28 the corporation learns that the customer filed for bankruptcy and none of the customer\u2019s balance of $200,000 will be collected. If the customer\u2019s financial condition on December 31 was already in\u00a0bankruptcy condition, the corporation must adjust its December 31 balance sheet by reducing its net receivables by $200,000 and reporting bad debts expense of $200,000 on its income statement for the year 2023. An example of the second situation is a loss arising from a catastrophe occurring on January 16, 2024. The amounts reported as of December 31, 2023 will not be adjusted since those amounts were correct as of December 31. However, the readers of the December 31, 2023 financial statements should be informed through a disclosure that a significant loss had occurred to the company\u2019s financial position since December 31.", "Definition of Standard Costing": "Standard costing  is a cost accounting system used by some manufacturers to assist in planning and controlling its manufacturing operations. When standard costing is used, the manufacturer\u2019s general ledger accounts for inventories (materials, work-in-process, finished goods) and the cost of goods sold will contain the standard costs. (Think of the standard costs as the \u201cshould be\u201d costs which are tied to the amounts in the company\u2019s profit plan.) Any differences between the actual costs and the standard costs will be recorded in cost variance  accounts. For external financial reporting, the variances must be allocated to the inventories and the cost of goods sold.", "Example of Standard Costing and GAAP": "Assume that a corporation\u2019s profit plan for the year uses $2 as the cost for every pound for its main raw material. Therefore, its standard costing system uses $2 per pound. Due to shortages, the corporation\u2019s actual cost for the 1,000,000 pounds of materials it purchased was $2.60 per pound. This means the general ledger accounts for its inventories and cost of goods sold contain $2 per pound for the materials and its materials purchase price variance account contains an unfavorable variance of $600,000 [1,000,000 X ($2.60 \u2013 $2.00)]. To comply with GAAP\u2019s cost principle, the corporation must allocate the $600,000 to the inventories and cost of goods sold when reporting its financial results. (If the corporation turned over its inventory many times during the year, most of the variance will be allocated to the cost of goods sold, since that is where most of the materials are.)", "Definition of Effect of LIFO Instead of FIFO": "During periods of significantly increasing costs, the LIFO cost flow assumption instead of the FIFO cost flow assumption will have the following effect:", "Examples of Effect on Financial Ratios from LIFO Instead of FIFO": "When there is significantly increasing costs, the following profitability ratios will be smaller under LIFO than FIFO:", "Definition of Lien": "A lien is a legal document filed by a creditor (lender) in order to record its claim on certain assets of the debtor (borrower). The lien is likely filed at the county government office where the debtor\u2019s property is located. The lien protects the creditor until the debtor pays the amount owed.

However, the credit manager\u2019s recent review indicates that the company will not be collecting a total of $25,000 of the accounts receivable. Based on the new information, the accountant should write an adjusting entry that debits Bad Debts Expense for $15,000 and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $15,000. After this adjusting entry is made: 1) the balance sheet will report the correct net amount of $205,000 ($230,000 \u2013 $25,000) not the overstated, incorrect amount of $220,000, and 2) the income statement will report the correct amount of net income, which is $15,000 less than the original, incorrect amount of net income. ", "Definition of Manufacturing Overhead Allocated to Products": "Manufacturing overhead refers to the indirect production costs of producing goods, products, component parts, etc. The manufacturing overhead costs are also known as factory overhead costs, burden, indirect manufacturing costs, and indirect product costs. Since manufacturing overhead is an indirect product cost, it needs to be allocated or assigned to the products manufactured and will cling to the products. Hence, the manufacturing overhead costs (along with the cost of the direct materials and direct labor) will be part of the cost of the items in inventory and the cost of the items sold. Accountants refer to this as full absorption costing. Accountants will also say that the manufactured goods must absorb both the variable and fixed manufacturing overhead costs.", "Definition of Arms Length Transaction": "An arms length transaction exists when two independent (unrelated) parties are each attempting to get the best deal possible.", "Example of Arms Length Transaction": "Assume a company builds single-family residences. An unrelated customer asks the company to inform them of the price for constructing a specific residence. The company prepares a detailed calculation of the final price that the customer will pay. The price will include the cost of all of the materials, labor, overhead, a cushion for the unexpected, and the company\u2019s required profit. Assume that the final amount is $240,000. The customer wants the house, but believes there is a little \u201cwiggle room\u201d in the $240,000. The company and the customer go back and forth and finally they agree on a price of $239,000. Since both parties were attempting to get the best price, the transaction is viewed as an arms length transaction. The resulting price should be close to the fair market price. On the other hand, if the daughter of the company\u2019s owner wants the company to build her the same house as the person above, the company may inform the daughter that the house will cost $225,000. Since the customer (the daughter) and the company are related parties, the transaction is not an arms length transaction. As a result, the daughter is able to get the house for less than the fair market price.", "Definition of Deferred Asset": "A deferred asset represents costs that have occurred, but because of certain circumstances the costs will be reported as expenses at a later time. You might consider a deferred asset to be a prepaid expense that does not qualify to be reported as a current asset.  A deferred asset might also be referred to as a deferred charge.", "Example of a Deferred Asset": "Assume that an electric utility spent $300,000 for a project before it had to be abandoned. The state regulators ruled that the utility may recover the $300,000 from its customers in the form of higher electricity rates over a 5-year period starting next year. Because of this assurance, the utility will record the $300,000 as a deferred asset. In each of the five subsequent years, the utility will credit the deferred asset account for $60,000 and will debit an expense for $60,000. Hence, the utility\u2019s $60,000 of increased expenses will be matched with the $60,000 of increased electricity revenues it will be reporting on its five annual income statements.", "Definition of Inventory Methods": "Inventory methods refers to the order or manner in which a company moves its actual costs out of the current asset inventory and to the cost of goods sold, which is reported on its income statement. Since the costs of products may be higher when they are reordered/purchased, the order in which their costs are removed from inventory will have an impact on the inventory valuation and the amount reported as the cost of goods sold (and therefore the gross profit, operating income, net income). The order in which the costs are removed from inventory is referred to as the cost flow assumption. It is important to understand that the cost flow does not have to agree with the order in which the goods are physically removed from inventory.", "Examples of Inventory Methods": "The following are only a few of the many cost flow assumptions used for valuing inventory:", "Where to Find a Corporation\u2019s Inventory Methods": "The inventory methods and cost flow assumptions used by a corporation (with shares of common stock that are publicly traded) can be found in the corporation\u2019s Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K. The Summary is likely the first or second item in the Notes to the Financial Statements. Most publicly traded corporations have an Investors Relations link on their website\u2019s home page. On the Investors Relations page you will find a link to the corporation\u2019s annual SEC filings.", "Definition of Present Value": "In accounting, present value refers to the amount after discounting future cash amounts to the present. The present is depicted on a timeline as the point 0, which is the beginning of period 1. The discounting process involves removing the time value of money or future interest which is contained (is implicit) within the future cash amounts. Accountants record the present value of a future amount when the cash amount, cash equivalent amount, or fair market value at the time of the transaction is not known.", "Example of Present Value": "Assume Website Services Corp (WSC) completed extensive and unique services for a client and agreed to a single payment of $100,000 to be made two years from now. The client\u2019s financial condition would require it to pay interest of 20% in order to borrow the money from a lender. WSC does not know the cash value of the unique services it provided nor does it know the market value. As a result, WSC discounts the future $100,000 by using the interest rate of 20% for two years to arrive at the present value of $69,400. WSC will record current revenues of $69,400 and a net receivable of $69,400 (Receivable of $100,000 minus Discount on Receivable of $30,600). As WSC earns the $30,600 of interest over the next two years, it will credit Interest Income and debit Discount on Receivable.", "Definition of a Retailer\u2019s Product Cost": "In accounting, a retailer\u2019s product cost is the cost paid to a supplier plus any other costs that are necessary to get the product in place and ready for sale.

Rather, they are reported as expenses on the income statement of the accounting period in which they were incurred.", "Definition of FIFO and LIFO": "FIFO and LIFO pertain to the flow of products\u2019 costs out of inventory to the cost of goods sold  that is reported on the income statement. First, if the costs of the inventory items never change, there will be no difference whether FIFO or LIFO is used. The reason is that the first costs (oldest costs) will be the same as the latest or recent costs. On the other hand, if the costs of the inventory items are increasing often and significantly, the differences in profits and inventory values between FIFO and LIFO will be significant.", "Example of LIFO with Increasing Costs": "In the U.S., LIFO is considered to be better when the costs of inventory items are changing. The reason is LIFO is matching the latest costs of products with the recent sales revenues. In addition, the U.S. tax\u00a0rules also allow for either FIFO or LIFO, but require the same cost flow assumption be used on both the company\u2019s tax return and on the company\u2019s\u00a0financial statements. With inflation being the norm, profitable companies using LIFO are matching the higher recent costs with the recent revenues and will be reporting lower taxable income and remitting smaller income tax payments.", "Definition of Capital Budgeting Decisions": "Capital budgeting assists in the investment decisions regarding assets that will have an impact on  more than one year. Some capital budgeting models use cash flows that are discounted for the time value of money. The time value of money recognizes that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar received in the future. Other capital budgeting models use cash flows without discounting them, while others use the accrual accounting revenues and expenses and also ignore the time value of money. Since the investments have an impact over many years, the preferred methods for capital budgeting decisions are those which use discounted cash flows. (In addition to using the discounted cash flow models, a company is likely to also calculate some non-discounted accrual accounting amounts to see how the investments will impact its future What is a financial statement?\u201d>financial statements.)", "Examples of Capital Budgeting Models": "The following are capital budgeting models that use cash flows which are then discounted to recognize the time value of money: ", "Definition of Form 10-K": "Form 10-K is a required annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by U.S. corporations whose common stock is publicly traded.

A debit amount is entered in Purchase Discounts Lost only if a company fails to pay a vendor\u2019s invoice within the vendor\u2019s early payment discount period. Purchase Discounts Lost is considered to be an interest expense or a financing charge resulting from the buyer not being able to pay the cash price. (Recall that in accounting cost is defined as the cash amount or the cash equivalent amount.)", "Example of Purchase Discounts Lost": "Assume that a retailer\u2019s policy is to always pay a vendor\u2019s legitimate invoice within the early payment discount period if such a discount is offered. Also assume that the retailer received a vendor\u2019s invoice for $1,000 which has payment terms of 2/10, net 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the retailer will enter the invoice in its accounting records with a debit of $980 ($1,000 minus 2% discount) to Purchases or Inventory and a credit of $980 to Accounts Payable. If the retailer pays the vendor\u2019s invoice within the 10-day early payment discount period, the retailer will record the payment with a debit of $980 to Accounts Payable and a credit of $980 to Cash. However, if the retailer fails to pay the invoice within the early payment discount period, the retailer is required to remit $1,000. In that case the retailer will credit Cash for $1,000; debit Accounts Payable for $980; and debit Purchase Discounts Lost for $20.

Transactions which are outside of a company\u2019s main business activities are referred to as nonoperating activities. ", "Gain vs Operating Income": "Let\u2019s assume that a company is a retailer whose main business activities are the purchasing and reselling of merchandise. When the retailer sells $5,000 of merchandise that it had purchased at a cost of $3,000, the retailer\u2019s income statement will report sales of merchandise of $5,000 and cost of goods sold of $3,000. The difference of $2,000 is part of the retailer\u2019s gross profit, operating income, and net income. The word \u201cgain\u201d is not appropriate since the activities involved the normal business activities of the retailer. However, if the same retailer sells its old delivery van, this transaction is outside of the retailer\u2019s main business activities of purchasing and selling merchandise. Therefore, the sale of the van will not be included with the sales of merchandise. Instead, a gain (or loss) will be reported as one of the company\u2019s nonoperating items often under the heading of other income.", "Calculating a Gain": "To illustrate the calculation of a gain, let\u2019s assume that the retailer sells its old van for $5,000 cash. At the time of the sale the van is on the retailer\u2019s books at $3,500 (which consists of its original cost of $20,000 and accumulated depreciation of $16,500). Since this transaction is not a main business activity of the retailer and since the $5,000 of cash received is greater than the net cost of $3,500 being removed from the accounts, the retailer will report a nonoperating item described as gain on sale of van of $1,500. ", "More Examples of Gains": "Other examples of gains that could appear on a company\u2019s income statement include:", "Definition of Obsolete Inventory": "Obsolete inventory refers to products that a company had purchased or produced which cannot be sold. The obsolete items may be the result of one or more of the following:", "Consequences of Obsolete Inventory": "When inventory items become obsolete, the reality is that their value is significantly lower than their cost. As a result, the U.S. accounting rules require that the cost of the obsolete inventory items be reduced to their net realizable value. Failure to reduce their cost will mean that the following amounts on the company\u2019s financial statements will be overstated:", "Benefits of Disposing of Obsolete Inventory": "Since the value of the obsolete items may continue to decrease, it is wise to dispose of the items at any price as soon as possible. The benefits of disposing of the obsolete items will result in the company:", "Definition of Opportunity Cost": "Opportunity cost is the profit that was lost or missed because of some action or failure to take some action. Some refer to opportunity cost as  opportunity lost.", "Example of Opportunity Costs": "Assume that you want to add a website to your already successful business. You are confident that it will increase your company\u2019s contribution margin by $1,500 a week. A highly-trusted and successful firm will complete the website within 4 weeks at a set price of $10,000. A friend offered to develop your website for $6,500 but it will take 7 weeks. Based on the out-of-pocket cost, your friend\u2019s bid looks better because of the $3,500 saved ($6,500 instead of $10,000). However, with your friend\u2019s work you will have lost the opportunity to earn an additional $4,500 (3 weeks at $1,500 a week). Therefore, the cost of you friend\u2019s work is $11,000 (the out-of-pocket cost of $6,500 + the opportunity cost of $4,500). The highly-trusted firm\u2019s cost of $10,000 now looks like the better option. Interestingly, the opportunity costs are not found or recorded in the general ledger accounts. Hence, if you selected your friend\u2019s offer, only the $6,500 paid to your friend will be recorded as the cost of the website. (The 3 weeks of missed profits are not recorded and will not be widely discussed.) This is also a reminder that the general ledger accounts are filled with past, historical amounts. Unfortunately, the relevant costs for decision making are the future costs and the opportunity costs (neither of which are not in the general ledger and are probably unknown at the time a decision must be made).", "Definition of Calendar Year": "A calendar year is the 12 consecutive months from January through December.

These external reports must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles often referred to as GAAP or US GAAP.", "Examples of Management Accounting": "Another part of accounting focuses on providing a company\u2019s management with the information needed to keep the business financially healthy. Although some of the information comes from recorded transactions, many of the analyses and reports include estimated and projected amounts based on various assumptions.

Rather, dividends are a distribution of the corporation\u2019s earnings. This explains why state laws likely require corporations to have a credit balance in Retained Earnings before declaring and paying dividends. Practically speaking, the corporation must also have sufficient cash available to meet its current and future needs.

Collecting accounts receivable is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due. The calculation of the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales for a year divided by the company\u2019s average amount of accounts receivable throughout that year. Note that only the company\u2019s credit sales (or sales on credit) are used in the calculation, since cash sales do not involve accounts receivable.", "Example of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio": "To illustrate the calculation of the accounts receivable turnover, let\u2019s assume that a company\u2019s credit sales for the most recent year were $6,000,000 and its average amount of accounts receivable during that year were $600,000. As a result, the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales of $6,000,000 divided by the average amount of accounts receivable of $600,000 = 10 times a year. This indicates that on average the company\u2019s accounts receivables turned over 10 times during the year, or approximately every 36 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 10). Whether the\u00a0accounts receivable\u00a0turnover ratio of 10 is good or bad depends on the company\u2019s past ratios,\u00a0the average for other companies in the same industry, and the specific credit terms given to the company\u2019s customers.", "Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is an Average": "Since the\u00a0accounts receivable turnover ratio is an average, it can be hiding some important details. For example, past due receivables could be hidden/offset by\u00a0receivables that have paid faster than the average. Therefore, if you have access to the company\u2019s details, you should review a detailed aging of accounts receivable to discover any past due accounts.", "Definition of Current Ratio": "The current ratio is the proportion, quotient, or relationship between the amount of a company\u2019s current assets and the amount of its current liabilities. The current ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of current assets by the amount of current liabilities.", "Example of Current Ratio": "If a company\u2019s current assets are $600,000 and its current liabilities are $200,000 the current ratio is 3:1. If the current assets are $600,000 and the current liabilities are $500,000 the current ratio is 1.2:1. Obviously a larger current ratio is better than a smaller ratio. Some people feel that a current ratio that is less than 1:1 indicates insolvency. However, some online sellers with customers paying with credit cards at the time of ordering may operate comfortably with a very low current ratio.  It is wise to compare a company\u2019s current ratio to that of other companies in the same industry. You are also wise to compare a company\u2019s recent current ratio to its ratio at earlier dates. In other words, spotting a trend can be important. Caution\nThe composition of the current assets is also an important consideration. If the current assets are predominantly in cash, marketable securities, and collectible accounts receivable, that is likely to provide more liquidity than a huge amount of slow moving inventory.", "Definition of Cash from Operating Activities": "Cash from operating activities usually refers to the first section of the statement of cash flows.

When a company earns revenue that had been prepaid by a customer, the company\u2019s balance sheet\u2019s liability deferred revenue will decrease and retained earnings will increase. ", "Examples of the Effect of Revenue on the Balance Sheet": "Examples of revenue include the sales of merchandise, service fee revenue, subscription revenue, advertising revenue, interest revenue, etc. The revenue accounts are temporary accounts that facilitate the preparation of the income statement. However, when a corporation earns revenue, it has the effect of increasing Retained Earnings. We can see this with the end-of-the-year closing entries which will move all the income statement account balances to Retained Earnings. Let\u2019s assume that today a corporation sold goods on credit. The corporation\u2019s current asset Accounts Receivable will increase and the company will credit the income statement account Sales. However, the Sales account is a temporary account that has the effect of increasing the corporation\u2019s retained earnings. Let\u2019s assume that on December 31 a corporation received $10,000 for services to be done in January. Therefore, the corporation\u2019s cash that is reported on the December 31 balance sheet includes the $10,000 and the balance sheet will also report a current liability deferred revenues of $10,000. In January, when the services have been provided, the corporation will record Service Fee Revenue of $10,000 (which has the effect of increasing the corporation\u2019s retained earnings) and will eliminate the current liability of $10,000 that appeared on the December 31 balance sheet.", "Definition of Compilation": "A compilation refers to a company\u2019s financial statements that have been prepared or compiled by an outside accountant.  A compilation is usually part of an accounting firm\u2019s write-up service. With compilations, or compiled financial statements, the outside accountant converts the client\u2019s data into financial statements without providing any assurances or auditing services. A compilation report should accompany the compiled financial statements to indicate that the financial statements 1) are the representation of the company\u2019s management, and 2) have not been reviewed or audited and therefore the accountant does not offer an opinion or any assurances on the financial statements. Compilations allow companies without an accountant to have financial statements prepared by an outside professional without the higher cost of reviewed or audited financial statements.", "Example of a Compilation": "A company prepares its own monthly financial statements by using popular accounting software. However, as part of the company\u2019s loan agreement with its bank, the company must provide the bank with annual financial statements that have been compiled by a certified public accountant.

However, the investors and potential investors in NEP will find it helpful to see the results of operations and the financial position of the group of companies (also referred to as the economic entity) consisting of the combination of NEP and MGC. The consolidated income statement of NEP will report all of the revenues that the group of companies earned from outside customers. (Since the sales of electricity from NEP to MGC and the sales of gas from MGC to NEP are not earned outside of the group of companies, those sales are eliminated when NEP\u2019s and MGC\u2019s income statements are combined to become the consolidated income statement.) The consolidated income statement will also report all the expenses that were incurred outside of the group of companies. (Since the purchases of electricity by MGC from NEP and the purchases of gas by NEP from MGC did not occur outside of the group of companies, these purchases are also eliminated.) The consolidated balance sheet of NEP will report all of the cash, receivables, plant, etc. of the group of companies (the economic entity).

At this point the rolling budget will cover the 12 months of March 2024 through February 2025. The benefit of a rolling budget is that the company\u2019s management will always have a budget that looks forward for one full year. A rolling budget could use 3-month periods or quarters instead of months. In addition, a company may have a 5-year rolling budget for capital expenditures. In this case a full year will be added to replace the year that has just ended.

(A more common method for calculating accelerated depreciation is the declining-balance method often used for U.S. income tax depreciation.) Compared to the straight-line depreciation method, the sum-of-the-years\u2019-digits method results in greater depreciation in the earlier years of an asset\u2019s useful life and less in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation over an asset\u2019s useful life should be the same regardless of which depreciation method is used. In other words, the difference is in the timing of when the same total amount of depreciation will be reported.", "Example of the Sum-of-the-Years\u2019-Digits Depreciation": "To illustrate SYD depreciation, assume that a service business purchases equipment at a cost of $160,000. This asset is expected to have a useful life of 5 years at which time it will be sold for $10,000. This means that the total amount of depreciation will be $150,000 spread over the equipment\u2019s useful life of 5 years. The next step is to sum (or add up) the digits in the five years of this asset\u2019s useful life: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The \u201c15\u201d will be the denominator for the fractions 5/15, 4/15, 3/15, etc. In the first full year of the asset\u2019s life, 5/15 of the $150,000 = $50,000 will be debited to Depreciation Expense and $50,000 will be credited to Accumulated Depreciation. In the second full year of the asset\u2019s life, the amount of depreciation will be $40,000 (4/15 of $150,000). In the third full year of the asset\u2019s life, the depreciation will be $30,000 (3/15 of $150,000). The fourth year depreciation will be $20,000 (2/15 of $150,000), and the fifth year will be $10,000 (1/15 of $150,000). Remember that the total amount of depreciation during this asset\u2019s useful life should be $150,000. Instead of adding the individual digits in the years of the asset\u2019s useful life, the following formula can be used to compute the sum of the digits: n(n+1) divided by 2, where n = the useful life in years. Using this formula in our example of an asset with a useful life of 5 years, we have: 5(5+1)/2 = 5(6)/2 = 30/2 = 15. If the above formula is used for an asset having a useful life of 10 years, the sum of the digits will be:  10(10+1)/2 = 10(11)/2 = 110/2 = 55. In the first year of an asset with a 10-year useful life, the depreciation will be 10/55 of the amount to be depreciated. The second year will use 9/55 and the tenth year will use 1/55.", "Definition of Bad Debts": "The term bad debts usually refers to accounts receivable (or trade accounts receivable) that will not be collected.

Under the periodic inventory system, there may also be an income statement account with the title Inventory Change or with the title (Increase) Decrease in Inventory. This account is presented as an adjustment to purchases in determining the company\u2019s cost of goods sold. ", "Example of Inventory Change": "Let\u2019s assume that last year\u2019s ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year\u2019s ending inventory is $115,000. Under the periodic inventory system, this inventory increase of $15,000 could be recorded as a debit of $15,000 to Inventory (thereby increasing the account balance from $100,000 to $115,000, and as a credit of $15,000 to Inventory Change. Next, assume that the company\u2019s net purchases for the year amounted to a net debit of $300,000. This $300,000 debit and the credit of $15,000 in Inventory Change results in the cost of goods sold of $285,000. The logic is that not all $300,000 of net purchases should be matched against sales since $15,000 of the purchases were added to inventory. (This is an alternative to the method used in introductory accounting textbooks, which is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = $400,000 of cost of goods available \u2013 ending inventory of $115,000 = cost of goods sold of $285,000.) Alternatively, if last year\u2019s ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year\u2019s ending inventory is $93,000, there will be a credit to Inventory for $7,000 and a debit to Inventory Change for $7,000. When the debit of $7,000 in the Inventory Change account is combined with the debit of $300,000 in net purchases, the cost of goods sold is $307,000. (The alternative is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = cost of goods available of $400,000 \u2013 ending inventory of $93,000 = cost of goods sold of $307,000.)", "Definition of Utility Bills": "Utility bills are invoices received by a company for the natural gas, electricity, water, and sewer charges that the company used during a previous month or other period of time. The usage and the amount of each bill is generally based on the meters located on the company\u2019s property. In other words, the utilities provide the gas, electricity, etc. in advance of being paid. Therefore, the company is receiving the gas, electricity, etc. before it pays for them and has a liability until the bills are paid. ", "Example of Utility Bills": "Let\u2019s assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and it uses natural gas for heating and it uses electricity for lighting and to operate its computers and equipment. Let\u2019s assume that the utility reads the meters on the last day of every month and prepares the utility bills based on the meters\u2019 readings. The retailer receives its first utility bills on January 8th and must remit the amount by February 2. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer\u2019s income statement for the month of December must report the cost of the gas and electricity that it used during December. On its December 31 balance sheet, the retailer must report the amounts it owes to the utilities as of December 31. If the utility bills for December\u2019s usage are not available at the time that the retailer\u2019s financial statements are prepared, the retailer will record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Utilities Expense and credits Accrued Utilities Payable for December\u2019s estimated amount. In our example, the utility bills for gas and electricity used in December are both an expense and a liability as of December 31. When the utility bills are paid, the liability is eliminated.", "Definition of Aging Method": "The aging method usually refers to the technique for estimating the amount of a company\u2019s accounts receivable that will not be collected. The estimated amount that will not be collected should be the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The debit balance in Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts will result in the estimated amount of the receivables that will be converted to cash. The aging method sorts each customer\u2019s unpaid invoices by invoice date into perhaps four columns:", "Example of Aging Method": "Let\u2019s assume that a company\u2019s Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $89,400. The aging method indicates that most of the customers are current. However, there are a few customers\u2019 invoices that are more than 60 days past due. Those past due accounts are reviewed closely and based on each customer\u2019s information it is estimated that approximately $7,400 of the $89,400 will not be collected. Therefore the credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts must be $7,400. This will result in the balance sheet reporting Accounts Receivable (Net) of $82,000.", "Definition of a Noncash Expense": "A noncash expense is an expense that is reported on the income statement of the current accounting period, but the related cash payment took place in another accounting period.", "Example of a Noncash Expense": "Perhaps the most common example of a noncash expense is depreciation. To illustrate, let\u2019s assume that a company purchased equipment two years ago for a cash payment of $200,000. The company determined that the equipment had a useful life of 10 years. As a result, the company\u2019s income statement will report depreciation expense of $20,000 a year for 10 years. The current year\u2019s income statement is reporting depreciation expense of $20,000 but there is no cash payment in the current year for this expense. This is why depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense. This also explains why the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows usually begins with a company\u2019s net income and then immediately adds the period\u2019s depreciation expense. In effect the noncash depreciation expense is added back because the depreciation expense had reduced the company\u2019s net income reported on the income statement, but it did not use any cash during that period of time.

The remaining $10,000 is deferred by reporting it as a current asset such as prepaid insurance, on its December 31 balance sheet. A deferral also occurs with revenues. The insurance company receiving the $12,000 for the six-month insurance premium beginning December 1 should report $2,000 as insurance premium revenues on its December income statement. The remaining $10,000 should be deferred to a balance sheet liability account, such as Unearned Premium Revenues.

Therefore, as of December 31, the company\u2019s balance sheet will report $600 as the current asset Prepaid Insurance.  During the month of January, the company should report $100 of insurance expense. At the end of January, the company\u2019s balance sheet should report Prepaid Insurance of $500 (indicating that $500 of the original $600 cost remains deferred).

The quick ratio assumes that only the following current assets are \u201cquick assets\u201d:", "Example of Quick Ratio": "If a company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents + marketable securities + accounts receivable adds up to $1,000,000 and the amount of the company\u2019s current liabilities is $1,200,000, its quick ratio is 0.83 to 1 ($1,000,000/$1,200,000 = 0.83). The quick ratio differs from the current ratio in that some current assets are excluded from the quick ratio. The most significant current asset that is excluded is inventory. The reason is that inventory might not be \u201cquick\u201d to turn to cash.", "Definition of Security Deposit": "A security deposit is often an amount paid by a tenant to a landlord to hold until the tenant moves. The amount of the security deposit is refundable to the tenant, if the rental unit remains in its present condition. Since the security deposit is refundable (and the tenant intends to comply with the specified conditions) the tenant that paid the security deposit will report the amount as an asset. If the tenant intends to occupy the rental unit for more than one year, the security deposit should be reported as a long-term asset (or noncurrent asset) under the balance sheet classification \u201cOther assets\u201d. The landlord that receives and holds the security deposit should report the amount as a liability.", "Example of a Security Deposit": "A company agrees to rent office space and intends to occupy the space for 3 years. The landlord requires a security deposit of $1,000. The company debits the long-term asset Security Deposit for $1,000 and credits Cash for $1,000. The landlord debits Cash for $1,000 and credits a liability account such as Refundable Security Deposits for $1,000.", "Definition of Net Working Capital": "Net working capital is the amount (as opposed to being a ratio) remaining after subtracting a company\u2019s total amount of current liabilities from its total amount of current assets. Hence, the formula is: net working capital = current assets minus current liabilities. (Net working capital is also known as working capital.)", "Examples of Changes in Working Capital": "If a company\u2019s owners invest additional cash in the company, the cash will increase the company\u2019s current assets with no increase in current liabilities. Therefore working capital will increase. If a company obtains a long-term loan to replace a current liability, current liabilities will decrease but current assets do not change. Therefore working capital will increase. If a company uses its cash to pay for a new vehicle or to expand one of its buildings, the company\u2019s current assets will decrease with no change to current liabilities. Therefore working capital will decrease. If a company sells merchandise for $50,000 that was in inventory at a cost of $30,000, the company\u2019s current assets will increase by $20,000. If no other expenses are incurred, working capital will increase by $20,000. If a company borrows $50,000 and agrees to repay the loan in 90 days, the company\u2019s working capital is unchanged. The reason is that the current asset Cash increased by $50,000 and the current liability Loans Payable increased by $50,000. If a company collects $30,000 of its accounts receivable, there is no change in working capital since the current asset Cash increased, and another current asset Accounts Receivable decreased.", "Definition of Gain or Loss on Sale of an Asset": "The gain or loss on the sale of an asset used in a business is the difference between 1) the amount of cash that a company receives, and 2) the asset\u2019s book value (carrying value) at the time of the sale. In order to know the asset\u2019s book value at the time of the sale, the depreciation expense for the asset must be recorded right up to the date that the asset is sold. If the cash received is greater than the asset\u2019s book value, the difference is recorded as a gain. If the cash received is less than the asset\u2019s book value, the difference is recorded as a loss.", "Example of a Gain on the Sale of an Asset": "On March 31, a company sells its old delivery van for $4,000. The van\u2019s original cost was $45,000 and its accumulated depreciation was $43,600 as of the date of the sale. Therefore, the van\u2019s book value as of March 31 was $1,400 (cost of $45,000 minus accumulated depreciation of $43,600). Since the $4,000 of cash received by the company was greater than the van\u2019s book value of $1,400, there is a gain on the sale of the van of $2,600 ($4,000 minus $1,400). The gain could also be determined by preparing the journal entry for the transaction:", "Definition of Negative Cash Balance": "A negative cash balance results when the cash account in a company\u2019s general ledger has a credit balance. The credit or negative balance in the checking account is usually caused by a company writing checks for more than it has in its checking account.", "Example of Reporting Negative Cash on the Balance Sheet": "When a company prepares its balance sheet, a negative balance in the cash account should be reported as a current liability which it might describe as checks written in excess of cash balance. The logic is that the company likely issued the checks to reduce its accounts payable. Since the issued checks will not be paid by the company\u2019s bank, the company still has the liability. A negative cash balance in the general ledger does not mean that the company\u2019s bank account is overdrawn. Let\u2019s assume that a company writes checks for $100,000 and mails them at the end of the day to suppliers in another state. Those checks might not clear the company\u2019s bank account until three or four days later. Therefore, it is possible that the company\u2019s Cash account shows a negative $40,000 but at the bank the company\u2019s checking account balance could have a positive balance of $60,000. If the company deposits at least $40,000 tomorrow morning, the bank balance will be large enough for the bank to pay the $100,000 of checks it had written.", "Definition of Construction Work-in-Progress": "Construction Work-in-Progress is a noncurrent asset account in which the costs of constructing long-term, fixed assets are recorded. The account Construction Work-in-Progress will have a debit balance and will be reported on the balance sheet as part of a company\u2019s noncurrent or long-term asset section entitled  Property, plant and equipment. The costs of constructing the asset are accumulated in the account Construction Work-in-Progress until the asset is completed and placed into service. When the asset is placed into service, the account Construction Work-in-Progress will be credited for its balance (the accumulated costs) and\u00a0will be recorded with a debit in the appropriate property, plant and equipment account. Depreciation will begin after the asset is put into service.", "Example of Construction Work-in-Progress": "Let\u2019s assume that a company is expanding its warehouse and the project is expected to take four months to complete. The company will open the account Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to accumulate the many expenditures that will occur. When the project is completed, the company will transfer the amount from Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to the asset account Warehouse Expansion.", "Examples of Capitalized Costs": "When a company constructs a new building, the interest incurred to finance its construction is capitalized. This means that the interest during construction will be part of the cost of the building (a noncurrent or long-term asset). The total cost will then be depreciated over the building\u2019s useful life. (On the other hand, interest to finance the company\u2019s operations or to build equipment is not capitalized. This interest is reported immediately as interest expense on the income statement.) If a company purchases an old machine in need of complete updating, the cost of the new components and the labor to rebuild the machine will be capitalized. This means that the total cost of the machine will be allocated to Depreciation Expense over the years of the machine\u2019s useful life. (On the other hand, the expenditures to get a machine back to its previous working condition are not capitalized. These expenditures should be charged immediately to Repairs and Maintenance Expense.)", "Definition of Carrying Amount": "The term carrying amount is also known as book value or carrying value. The term carrying amount is often used when there is a valuation account associated with another general ledger account.  ", "Examples of Carrying Amount": "Here are some examples when the term carrying amount or carrying value is used:", "Definition of Days\u2019 Sales in Inventory": "The financial ratio days\u2019 sales in inventory tells you the number of days it took a company to sell its inventory during\u00a0a recent year. Keep in mind that a company\u2019s inventory will change throughout the year, and its sales will fluctuate as well. Therefore, you should view this as an average from the past. The calculation of the days\u2019 sales in inventory\u00a0is: the number of days in a year (365 or 360\u00a0days)\u00a0divided by the inventory turnover ratio.", "Example of Days\u2019 Sales in Inventory": "To illustrate the days\u2019 sales in inventory, let\u2019s assume that in the previous year a company\u00a0had an inventory turnover ratio of 9.\u00a0Using 360 as the number of days in the year, the company\u2019s days\u2019 sales in inventory was 40 days (360 days divided by 9). Since sales and inventory levels usually fluctuate during a year, the 40 days is an average from a previous time. It is important to realize that a financial ratio will likely vary between industries. Hence, a company\u2019s ratios should be compared to its own past financial ratios and to the ratios of companies within its industry. ", "Definition of Net Realizable Value": "Net realizable value (NRV) is the cash amount that a company expects to receive. Hence, net realizable value is sometimes referred to as cash realizable value. We often find the term net realizable value being associated with the current assets accounts receivable and inventory. While these two assets are initially recorded at cost, there are occasions when the company will collect less than the cost. When that occurs, the company must report the lower of 1) cost, or 2) the net realizable value.   In the case of accounts receivable, net realizable value can also be expressed as the debit balance in the asset account Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.  In the context of inventory, net realizable value is the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.", "Examples of Net Realizable Value": "If Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $100,000 and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts has a proper credit balance of $8,000, the resulting net realizable value of the accounts receivable is $92,000. Adjustments to the Allowance account are reported on the income statement as bad debts expense. Now, let\u2019s assume that a company\u2019s inventory has a cost of $15,000. However, at the end of the accounting year the inventory can be sold for only $14,000 after it spends $2,000 for packaging, sales commissions, and shipping. Therefore, the net realizable value of the inventory is $12,000 (selling price of $14,000 minus $2,000 of costs to dispose of the goods). In that situation the inventory must be reported at the lower of 1) the cost of $15,000, or 2) the NRV of $12,000. In this situation, the inventory should be reported on the balance sheet at $12,000, and the income statement should report a loss of $3,000 due to the write-down of inventory.", "Definition of Drawings": "Drawings are the withdrawals of a sole proprietorship\u2019s business assets by the owner for the owner\u2019s personal use. The drawings or draws by the owner (L. Webb) are recorded in an owner\u2019s equity account such as L. Webb, Drawings; L. Webb, Draws; or L. Webb, Withdrawals. The other part of the entry will reduce the specific business asset.", "Example of Drawings": "If the owner (L. Webb) draws $5,000 of cash from her business, the accounting entry will be a debit of $5,000 to the account L. Webb, Drawings and a credit of $5,000 to the account Cash.", "Effect of Drawings on the Financial Statements": "The owner\u2019s drawings will affect the company\u2019s balance sheet by decreasing the asset that is withdrawn and by the decrease in owner\u2019s equity. The owner\u2019s drawings of cash will also affect the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. (If an asset other than cash is withdrawn, it is reported as supplemental information on the statement of cash flows.) The income statement is not affected by the owner\u2019s drawings since the drawings are not business expenses.", "Definition of Notes Receivable": "Notes receivable is an asset of a company, bank or other organization that holds a written promissory note from another party. (The other party will have a note payable.) The principal part of a note receivable that is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date is reported in the current asset section of the lender\u2019s balance sheet. The remaining principal of the note receivable is reported in the noncurrent asset section entitled Investments.", "Examples of Notes Receivable": "A company lends one of its important suppliers $10,000 and the supplier gives the company a written promissory note to repay the amount in six months along with interest at 8% per year. The company will debit its current asset account Notes Receivable for the principal amount of $10,000. The credit of $10,000 will be to Cash.  If a company borrows $100,000 from its bank and signs a promissory note to pay 6% interest quarterly and the principal amount in 9 months, the bank will debit its current asset account Notes Receivable and will credit Cash or Customers\u2019 Deposits for the principal amount of $100,000.", "Definition of Current Portion of Long-Term Debt": "The current portion of long-term debt is the amount of principal that will be due within one year of the date of the balance sheet. This amount is reported on the balance sheet as one of the company\u2019s current liabilities.

The current liability section of the balance sheet will report Current portion of long term debt of $18,000. The remaining amount of principal due at the balance sheet date will be reported as a noncurrent or long-term liability. ", "Definition of Working Capital Turnover Ratio": "The working capital turnover ratio is also referred to as net sales to working capital. It indicates a company\u2019s effectiveness in using its working capital. The working capital turnover ratio is calculated as follows: net annual sales divided by the average amount of working capital during the same year.", "Example of Working Capital Turnover Ratio": "To illustrate the working capital turnover ratio, let\u2019s assume that a company\u2019s\u00a0net sales for the most recent year were $2,400,000 and its average amount of working capital during the year was $400,000. Therefore, its working capital turnover ratio was: net sales of $2,400,000 divided by average working capital of $400,000 = 6 times during the year.

Plant assets are also known as fixed assets. Plant assets are recorded at their cost and depreciation expense is recorded during their useful lives. Plant assets (other than land) are depreciated over their useful lives and each year\u2019s depreciation is credited to a contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation. Plant assets and the related accumulated depreciation are reported on a company\u2019s balance sheet in the noncurrent asset section entitled property, plant and equipment.

(Some states may require a corporation to have a par value while others states do not require a par value.) (Par value can also refer to an amount that appears on bond certificates.) In the case of common stock the par value per share is usually a very small amount such as $0.10 or $0.01 and it has no connection to the market value of the share of stock. The par value is sometimes referred to as the common stock\u2019s legal capital. When a corporation\u2019s common or preferred stock has a par value, corporation\u2019s balance sheet will report the total par value of the shares issued for each class of stock.

This means that during the next 12 months, the company will be required to repay $36,000 ($3,000 x 12 months) of the loan\u2019s principal. Therefore $36,000 is reported as a current liability. The remaining principal of $202,000 ($238,000 minus $36,000) is reported as a long-term (or noncurrent) liability since this amount will not be due within one year of the balance sheet date.

If the amount received is greater than the par value, the difference is known as the premium on bonds payable. If the amount received is less than the par value, the difference is known as the discount on bonds payable. The premium and discount accounts are viewed as valuation accounts. The unamortized premium on bonds payable will have a credit balance that increases the carrying amount (or the book value) of the bonds payable. The unamortized discount on bonds payable will have a debit balance and that decreases the carrying amount (or book value) of the bonds payable.

LIFO will result in the company\u2019s recent higher costs being included in the cost of goods sold. As a result, the company will report less gross profit, less net income, less taxable income, and less income taxes than the FIFO cost flow assumption. LIFO also results in the company\u2019s older, lower costs remaining in inventory.

The goal is to have an inventory turnover ratio as large as possible without losing sales and/or customers.", "How to Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio": "The calculation for the inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold for a year divided by average inventory during the same 12 months.  A higher inventory turnover ratio is viewed as better than a lower ratio. Note: The cost of goods sold is used (not sales) in calculating the inventory turnover ratio because the company\u2019s inventory is recorded and reported at its cost (not at its selling prices). However, be cautioned that some people will use sales and therefore will be overstating the inventory turnover ratio. It is also important to use the average amount of inventory throughout the entire year since using only the end-of-the-year amounts may result in a much lower average.", "Example of Inventory Turnover Ratio": "To illustrate the inventory turnover ratio, let\u2019s assume that during the most recent year a company\u2019s cost of goods sold was $3,600,000 and the average cost of its inventory account during the year was $400,000. As a result, the company\u2019s inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold of $3,600,000 divided by average inventory of $400,000 =  9 times during the recent year. This could be compared to the company\u2019s ratio in previous years and to other companies in the same industry. Even with a favorable inventory turnover ratio, a company\u00a0may have some excess and obsolete inventory items. Therefore, it is wise to\u00a0compare\u00a0the quantity of each\u00a0item in inventory to the quantity of each item sold during the past year.", "Definition of Overstating Inventory": "Overstating inventory means that the reported amount for the cost of a company\u2019s inventory is greater than the actual true cost based on accounting rules.

For profitable corporations, interest expense also reduces its taxable income and the corresponding income tax expense. The income tax savings ultimately reduces the net cost of the interest paid. Since the corporation entered into a contract to pay interest to its lenders, if the interest is not paid the corporation can face legal consequences. As a result, any accrued interest expense and the related liability must be recorded by the corporation.", "Example of Dividends vs. Interest": "If a profitable corporation declares and pays cash dividends of $100,000, the corporation\u2019s cash and its retained earnings (and therefore its stockholders\u2019 equity) are reduced by $100,000. However, the corporation\u2019s net income is not reduced as dividends are not a business expense. Assume that a different profitable corporation pays $100,000 in interest to its lenders. The $100,000 will appear on the corporation\u2019s income statement as interest expense and will reduce the line net income before income tax expense and the line income tax expense. If the corporation\u2019s incremental combined federal and local income tax rate is 30%, the corporation will reduce its income tax expense and tax payments by $30,000. This means that the corporation\u2019s net cost of the borrowed money is $70,000 ($100,000 of interest paid to lenders minus $30,000 of income tax savings).

It purchased 30 units in January at a cost of $40 each, 30 units in June at $43 each, and 30 units in November at $46 each. Thus, for the year the retailer purchased 90 units with a total actual cost of $3,870 [30@$40 + 30@$43 + 30@$46]. Let\u2019s also assume that 70 units were sold and that 20 units remain in inventory at the end of the year. Using FIFO the company assumes that first costs (the oldest costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory and will become the cost of goods sold. Therefore, the FIFO cost of the 70 units sold had a cost of $2,950 [30@$40 + 30@$43 + 10@$46]. FIFO also means the 20 units remaining in inventory had the most recent cost of $46 each for a total of $920. Using LIFO and the periodic inventory system, the company assumes that the last costs (the most recent actual costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory first and will become the cost of goods sold regardless of which units were physically shipped to customers. Therefore, the LIFO cost of the 70 units sold is $3,070 [30@$46 + 30@$43 + 10@$40]. LIFO also means that the 20 units remaining in inventory had the oldest cost of $40 each for a total of $800. In our example, LIFO results in $120 less of ending inventory ($800 vs. $920), $120 more of cost of goods sold, and therefore $120 less of gross profit. The lower gross profit and the associated lower taxable income for a U.S. company can result in less taxable income, which may result in less income tax payments for a profitable corporation.", "Definition of Debt Ratio": "The debt ratio is also known as the debt to asset ratio or the total debt to total assets ratio. Hence, the formula for the debt ratio is: total liabilities divided by total assets. The debt ratio indicates the percentage of the\u00a0total asset amounts (as reported on the balance sheet) that is owed to creditors. The larger the debt ratio the greater is the company\u2019s financial leverage. The appropriate debt ratio depends on the industry and factors that are unique to the company.

The corporation\u2019s debt ratio is 0.60 or 60% ($60,000 divided by $100,000).", "Definition of Product Warranty Liability": "A product warranty means the manufacturer or seller has a potential liability and expense if its product or service fails to live up to the warranty during the period of the warranty. This type of warranty is referred to as an assurance-type warranty.  In accounting jargon, the assurance-type warranty is an example of a contingent that is both probable and can be estimated. Therefore, a company must record in the period of the sale the estimated cost of repairing or replacing the product during the warranty period. That expected cost is recorded as a liability on its balance sheet and as an expense on its income statement. Note that the expected future cost to repair or replace is matched with the sales revenue in the period of the sale. When the repair or replacement occurs, the warranty liability is reduced.  Think of those future repair/replacement costs as a selling or promotion expense to get the sale to occur. Periodically, the credit balance in the Warranty Liability account is reviewed to be certain that the estimated amounts were reasonable. If they are not, the amount recorded at the time of each sale will be increased or decreased.", "Example of Product Warranty Liability": "Assume that an automobile manufacturer has found that it spends $1,000 in labor and parts for the necessary repairs covered under its two year warranty. If the manufacturer sells 5,000 cars in the first month of its accounting year, the manufacturer must debit Warranty Expense for $5,000,000 (5,000 cars X $1,000)and will credit Warranty Liability for $5,000,000.

These amounts result in the following:", "Definition of Liquidity": "Liquidity usually refers to a company\u2019s ability to pay its bills when they become due. Liquidity is often evaluated by comparing a company\u2019s current assets to its current liabilities. The following are often referred to as liquidity ratios  or short-term solvency ratios since they assist in evaluating a company\u2019s ability to pay its current obligations:", "Current Assets": "Generally, the assets that are expected to turn to cash within one year are reported on the balance sheet in the section with the heading current assets. Current assets are listed in the order in which they are expected to turn to cash. This is known as the order of liquidity. Since cash is the most liquid asset, it is listed first. After cash, the order is: temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, supplies, and prepaid expenses.", "Evaluating Liquidity": "Liquidity depends on 1) the speed at which the assets should be turning to cash, or 2) the assets\u2019 nearness to cash. For example, some temporary investments are marketable and can be converted to cash very quickly. Accounts receivable may be converted to cash in 10 to 40 days. However, inventory may require several months to be sold and the money collected. Hence, inventory is not considered to be a \u201cquick asset.\u201d To assist in evaluating a company\u2019s liquidity, the financial ratio known as the quick ratio or acid-test ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the company\u2019s quick assets (cash, temporary investments, and accounts receivable) by the amount of the company\u2019s current liabilities. [An alternate calculation of the quick ratio is to begin with the amount of the current assets and subtract the amount of inventory. The remainder is then divided by the amount of current liabilities.]", "Some Inventory May Not Provide Liquidity": "While the current ratio is also referred to as a liquidity ratio, a company with the majority of its current assets in inventory may or may not have the liquidity needed to pay its liabilities as they come due. Its liquidity depends on the speed in which the inventory can be converted to cash.", "Definition of Treasury Stock": "Treasury stock is usually a corporation\u2019s previously issued shares of common stock that have been purchased from the stockholders, but the corporation has not retired the shares. The number of shares of treasury stock (or treasury shares) is the difference between the number of shares issued and the number of shares outstanding. Since the treasury shares result in fewer shares outstanding, there may be a slight increase in the corporation\u2019s earnings per share. Treasury Stock is also the title of a general ledger account that will have a debit balance equal to the cost of the repurchased shares being held by the corporation. The corporation\u2019s cost of treasury stock reduces the corporation\u2019s cash and the total amount of stockholders\u2019 equity. The shares of treasury stock will not receive dividends, will not have voting rights, and cannot result in an income statement gain or loss. The shares of treasury stock can be sold, retired, or could continue to be held as treasury stock.", "Example of Treasury Stock": "A corporation has excess cash and does not see any attractive investments. As a result, it decides to purchase 10,000 shares of its 300,000 shares of common stock that is held by its stockholders. The market value of the 10,000 shares is $40 per share.

For example, a profitable public utility might finance half of the cost of a new electricity generating power plant by issuing 30-year bonds. If the current market interest rate for the bonds is 4%, the cost after the income tax savings may be only 3%.", "Definition of Bond Sinking Fund": "A bond sinking fund is an investment made by a corporation that is restricted for the purpose of retiring its bonds payable, which is a long-term liability. Since the money in the sinking fund is restricted for a long-term purpose, it cannot be used to pay its short-term liabilities. Therefore, the sinking fund is not a current asset nor is it part of the corporation\u2019s working capital.", "Example of Bond Sinking Fund": "ABC Corporation is planning to issue $20 million of 20-year bonds. Potential investors are requiring that ABC establish a bond sinking fund into which ABC will make annual deposits of $500,000. An independent trustee will invest the corporation\u2019s annual deposits with the goal of the sinking fund balance growing to approximately $20 million by the time the bonds come due in 20 years. The corporation will report the bond sinking fund balance in the investments section of its balance sheet. The investments section appears immediately after the current asset section. ", "Definition of Capital Expenditures": "Capital expenditures are the amounts spent for tangible assets that will be used for more than one year in the operations of a business. Capital expenditures, which are sometimes referred to as capex, can be thought of as the amounts spent to acquire or improve a company\u2019s fixed assets. The capital expenditures increase the respective asset accounts which are reported in the noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet entitled property, plant and equipment. Once the assets (except for land) are placed in service they are depreciated over their useful lives. The accumulated depreciation for these assets is also reported as part of the property, plant and equipment. The amount of capital expenditures for an accounting period is also reported in the cash flow statement as a negative amount (since it is a cash outflow) in the investing activities section.

The reason is the cash in the sinking fund must be used to retire bonds and cannot be used to pay current liabilities.", "Definition of Accounts Receivable Collection Period": "The accounts receivable collection period is similar to the days sales outstanding or the days sales in accounts receivable. The accounts receivable collection period is calculated as follows:", "Example of Accounts Receivable Collection Period": "Assume a corporation had net credit sales of $360,000 during the past year and its accounts receivable balance was on average $40,000. The average credit sales per day were approximately $1,000 per day ($360,000 of annual credit sales divided by 360 or 365 days per year). The average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 divided by $1,000 of credit sales per day = 40 days. Calculating the accounts receivable collection period using the accounts receivable turnover ratio, you first determine the accounts receivable turnover ratio. The calculation is $360,000 of net credit sales divided by the average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 = 9. Next, divide 360 days per year by the accounts receivable turnover of 9 = 40 days.", "Definition of Current Liabilities and Long-term Liabilities": "Generally, current liabilities are a company\u2019s obligations that are due within one year of the balance sheet\u2019s date and will require a cash payment or will need to be renewed. Long-term (or noncurrent) liabilities are the obligations that are not due within one year of the balance sheet date and will not require a cash payment. Typically, companies issue classified balance sheets. This means that the current assets and current liabilities are listed in separate sections of the balance sheet. The classified balance sheets allow the users of this financial statement to quickly determine the amount of the company\u2019s working capital and current ratio. Both of these metrics are useful in determining a company\u2019s ability to meet its current or short-term obligations.", "Examples of Current Liabilities and Long-term Liabilities": "Often a company\u2019s current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventories. It\u2019s current liabilities typically include accounts payable, loan payments due within one year of the balance sheet date, and wages payable. Long-term liabilities may include loan principal payments not due within one year of the balance sheet date. For example, a mortgage loan on a company\u2019s building will likely have 12 monthly payments due within one year of the balance sheet date and perhaps an additional 60 monthly payments due after the balance sheet date. The principal portion of those monthly payments (not the interest portion since the interest is not yet a liability) is reported on the balance sheet. It is possible that a mortgage principal balance of $150,000 will mean a current liability of $15,000 and a long-term liability of $135,000. Assume that the total amount of company\u2019s current assets is $120,000, and the total amount of its current liabilities is $100,000. This means the company\u2019s working capital is $20,000 and its current ratio is 1.2 ($120,000 / $100,000). Being able to quickly see that the company has only $20,000 in working capital is important information for the company, its investors, and its creditors.

These amounts result in the following:", "Definition of Discount on Bonds Payable": "Discount on bonds payable (or bond discount) occurs when a corporation issues bonds and receives less than the bonds\u2019 face or maturity amount. The root cause of the bond discount is the bonds have a stated interest rate which is lower than the market interest rate for similar bonds. The difference between the amount received and the face or maturity amount is recorded in the corporation\u2019s general ledger contra liability account Discount on Bonds Payable. This amount will then be amortized to Bond Interest Expense over the life of the bonds. ", "Example of Discount on Bonds Payable": "Assume that a corporation prepares to issue bonds having a maturity amount of $10,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6% (per year). However, when the bonds are actually sold to investors, the market interest rate is 6.1%. Since these bonds will be paying the investors less than the market rate of interest ($300,000 semiannually instead of $305,000), the investors will pay less than $10,000,000 for the bonds.  Assume the investors pay $9,800,000 for the bonds having a face or maturity value of $10,000,000. The difference of $200,000 will be recorded by the issuing corporation as a debit to Discount on Bonds Payable, a debit to Cash for $9,800,000, and a credit to Bonds Payable for $10,000,000. Over the life of the bonds, the initial debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable will decrease as it is amortized to Bond Interest Expense.

This is a short run view since the focus is on the company\u2019s current assets and its current liabilities. Others look at a company\u2019s total assets and total liabilities or the company\u2019s debt to equity ratio when deciding whether a company is solvent. A company\u2019s solvency is also at risk if it is unable to operate profitably. I suspect that the definition of\u00a0solvency varies among people in the same country and from country to country.

When the balances of these three purchases accounts are combined, the resulting amount is known as net purchases. When goods are sold under the periodic inventory system there is no entry to credit the Inventory account or to debit the account Cost of Goods Sold. Hence, the Inventory account contains only the ending balance from the previous year. As a result, the company must compute an inventory amount at the end of each accounting period in order to report the amount of its ending inventory for its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold for its income statement.", "Computing the Inventory Amount Under the Periodic Inventory Method": "At the end of an accounting year, the company\u2019s ending inventory is normally computed based on a physical count of its inventory items. However, the inventory amounts for the monthly and quarterly financial statements are usually estimates. Under the periodic inventory system the cost of goods sold is computed as follows: beginning inventory (previous year\u2019s ending inventory cost) + net purchases = cost of goods available \u2013 costs computed for the ending inventory = cost of goods sold. An alternative format is: net purchases plus the decrease in inventory or minus the increase in inventory = cost of goods sold.", "Inventory Records Outside of the General Ledger": "It should be noted that companies using the periodic inventory system in their general ledger accounts often have sophisticated inventory systems outside of the general ledger for tracking the items it purchases, produces, sells and has on hand.", "Example and Limitations of the Inventory Turnover Ratio": "As an example, assume that in its recent year a company had sales of $7 million, cost of goods sold (COGS) of $5 million, and an average inventory cost of $1 million. This means the company\u2019s inventory turnover was on average 5 (or 5 times) calculated by dividing the COGS of $5 million of cost of goods sold by $1 million of inventory cost. (This indicates that on average the company turned its inventory every 72 days.) A limitation of the inventory turnover is that it is an average, which means that some important details may be hidden. For instance, what if four inventory items make up 40% of the company\u2019s sales but make up only 10% of the inventory cost? These fast selling items will have a turnover ratio of 20 (40% of the COGS = $2 million divided by $100,000, which is 10% of $1 million). This means that the remaining items in inventory will have a cost of goods sold of $3,000,000 and their average inventory cost will be $900,000. As a result, the majority of the items in inventory will have an average turnover ratio of 3.3 ($3,000,000 divided by $900,000). In other words, the fast selling items are turning every 18 days (365 days/20) and the majority of the items are turning on average every 109 days (365/3.3). That information is being hidden when the focus is on the average of 72 days. It is also likely there is another group of inventory items that are turning even less than 3.3 times during the year. People within the company can overcome the shortcomings described above by computing the inventory turnover ratio and the days\u2019 sales in inventory for each and every item in inventory. By reviewing the turnover ratio for each item, the slow moving items cannot be hidden by the overall turnover ratio.", "Examples of Reasons for Retained Earnings": "The following are some examples of the reasons for a corporation to not distribute its retained earnings as cash dividends to its stockholders:", "Physically Counting the Items in Inventory": "One method for calculating the cost of a company\u2019s ending inventory is to 1) physically count the quantity of each of the items in inventory and then 2) multiply those quantities by each item\u2019s actual unit cost. The actual unit costs must be consistent with the cost flow assumption (FIFO, weighted-average, etc.) that was elected by the company. Special attention is required for items that are on consignment or are in transit. Taking the physical counts can be very time consuming and complicated especially when inventory items are moving between operations. As a result, large companies are likely to physically count the inventory items only at the end of the accounting year.", "Using the Quantities in the Company\u2019s Inventory System": "A second method which can be used for interim financial statements is to calculate the ending inventory by using the quantities on the company\u2019s inventory system. Those quantities are multiplied by the actual unit costs that reflect the company\u2019s cost flow assumption. (Throughout the year the inventory system\u2019s quantities should be adjusted to agree with any physical counts. Some companies will physically count a different group of inventory items each month and compare those counts to the system\u2019s quantities.)", "Estimating the Cost of the Ending Inventory": "A third approach is to use the gross profit method to calculate the estimated cost of the ending inventories that will be used on the interim financial statements.", "Definition of Liquidation": "Liquidation is a term commonly used to describe a company selling parts of its business for cash,  selling its assets in order to pay debts, or the process of winding down or closing a business.", "Example of Accelerated Depreciation": "Assume a corporation acquires equipment with a cost of $600,000 that will be used in its business for 10 years (120 months) and have no salvage value at the end of 10 years. On its monthly financial statements, the corporation will likely report Depreciation Expense of $5,000 for 120 months. However, on its U.S. income tax return, the corporation is allowed to depreciate the asset over 7 years at an accelerated rate. Often the income tax regulations (See IRS.gov) allow special depreciation in which the equipment will be expensed sooner or even immediately. This could result in a significant reduction in the amount of income taxes to be paid in the early years of an asset\u2019s life, which in turn reduces the time required for the corporation to recover the amount it paid for the equipment.", "Definition of Quick Assets": "Quick assets are a company\u2019s current assets which can quickly be converted into cash.

SG&A will not include interest expense since interest expense is reported as a nonoperating expense.", "Definition of Commissions": "Commissions are compensation for obtaining sales. Hence, sales commissions are a selling expense and will be recorded in general ledger accounts having Sales Commissions Expenses in their title. Sales commissions are considered to be operating expenses and are presented on the income statement as SG&A expenses. (SG&A is the acronym for selling, general and administrative expenses.)

A manufacturer sells a product for $40 and its cost of goods sold (which consists of its manufacturing costs) is $28. Therefore, the product\u2019s gross margin is $12 ($40 minus $28), or 30% of the selling price ($12/$40).", "Difference Between Gross Margin and Profit Margin": "Gross margin is the amount or percent before subtracting the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses.

It has been determined that $10,000 of the rent pertains to the manufacturing facilities. The remaining $5,000 is for rent for housing the nonmanufacturing functions such as selling, general and administration. The $10,000 of manufacturing rent is part of the manufacturing overhead, which is an indirect product cost that must be assigned to units of product manufactured on a logical basis. As a result, part of the rent is included in the units\u2019 costs which are in inventory or have been sold. When a unit of product is sold, the manufacturing rent that is included in the product cost will be part of the cost of goods sold that is reported on the income statement.

If the company\u2019s accounts payable had increased by $900, the company must not have paid for $900 of the expenses reported on the income statement. Therefore, the company\u2019s cash balance would increase by $5,900. Expressed differently, the revenues of $20,000 minus the $14,100 of cash paid for expenses ($15,000 minus the $900 of expenses not yet paid) means an increase in cash of $5,900. Hence, the positive adjustment of $900 converts the accrual accounting net income of $5,000 to be the cash amount of $5,900.", "An Increase in Accounts Payable is Favorable for a Company\u2019s Cash Balance": "It may help to view the positive amounts on the SCF as being favorable or good for a company\u2019s cash balance.

[Note: some retailers may use the term markup to mean an additional markup from an earlier selling price.] The markup is also expressed as a percentage of cost (not selling price).", "Example of Markup": "Assume that a product has a cost of $8 and the seller sets a selling price of $10. In dollars, the markup is $2 (the same as the $2 gross profit). However, the markup is usually expressed as a percentage of the product\u2019s cost (not its selling price). Therefore, the $2 markup divided by the product\u2019s cost of $8 results in a markup that is 25% of cost. Thus, if a retailer wants its income statement to show a gross profit that is 20% of sales, the retailer must mark up its products\u2019 costs by 25%.", "Definition of Average Collection Period": "The average collection period is the average number of days between 1) the dates that credit sales were made, and 2) the dates that the money was received/collected from the customers. The average collection period is also referred to as the days\u2019 sales in accounts receivable.", "Formula for Calculating the Average Collection Period": "One formula for calculating the average collection period is: 365 days in a year divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio. An alternate formula for calculating the average collection period is: the average accounts receivable balance divided by the  average credit sales per day.", "Example of Average Collection Period": "Assume that a company had on average $40,000 of accounts receivable during the most recent year. During that year the company had credit sales of $400,000. One calculation of the average collection period is to first determine the accounts receivable turnover ratio,  which is $400,0000 divided by $40,000 = 10 times per year. Since there were 365 days during the recent year, the average collection period is 365 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10 = 36.5 days. Using the alternate formula we first determine the average credit sales per day, which is the $400,000 of credit sales divided by 365 days = $1,096. Next, the average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 is divided by the average credit sales per day of $1,096, which also results in 36.5 days.

Accounting ratios will often relate one financial statement amount to another financial statement amount. For instance, the inventory turnover ratio divides a company\u2019s cost of goods sold for a recent year by the company\u2019s average inventory during that year. Perhaps the most frequently used accounting ratio is the current ratio, which divides a company\u2019s current assets by its current liabilities. A company\u2019s accounting ratios can be compared to the ratios of other companies in the same industry. An accounting ratio can also be compared to the company\u2019s same ratio in recent periods to see whether the company is improving or declining.

The earnings in excess of the interest expense on the new debt will increase the earnings of the corporation\u2019s\u00a0common stockholders. The increase in earnings indicates that the corporation was successful in trading on equity.

The interest expense associated with bonds payable is deductible from a U.S. corporation\u2019s taxable income. In other words, a profitable corporation will save paying income tax on the amount of the interest expense. The amount of the income tax savings depends on the amount of the interest expense and the corporation\u2019s federal and state incremental income tax rates. In this context, stock usually refers to shares of common stock, which is evidence of an ownership interest in a corporation. Corporations decide whether it will distribute some of its earnings in the form of dividends to its stockholders. Dividends are not an expense and therefore do not reduce the corporation\u2019s net income or its taxable income.", "Example of Tax Advantage of Bonds Instead of Stock": "If a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds having an interest rate of 8%, its annual interest expense will be $800,000. When the $800,000 of interest expense is entered on the corporation\u2019s income tax return, its taxable income will decrease by $800,000. If the corporation\u2019s combined federal and state income tax rate on this increment is 40%, the corporation will save paying income taxes of $320,000 ($800,000 of less taxable income X 40%). If the corporation\u2019s income tax rate on this increment is 30%, the corporation will save paying income taxes of $240,000 ($800,000 X 30%). Due to the income tax savings, the net cost of the borrowed money is reduced. In the above example in which the corporation had an incremental tax rate of 40%, its net cost of the borrowed money is $480,000 ($800,000 of interest minus $320,000 of income tax savings) or 4.8% ($480,000/$10,000,000).

Traditionally, ROI related 1) the income statement profit to the 2) the balance sheet investment. A drawback of ROI is that the accounting amounts (revenues, expenses, asset book values, etc.) ignore the time value of money.", "Examples of ROI": "In the past, ROI was helpful for monitoring the decentralized divisions of large diverse corporations. The ROI calculation meant dividing division\u2019s operating income by the average amount of operating assets being utilized by the division. For instance, if one of a corporation\u2019s divisions reported operating income of $1 million and it had $10 million of operating assets, its ROI was 10%. In recent times, it\u2019s common to see ROI being used in the context of internet marketing and/or the adoption of wellness programs at large companies.

If an outstanding check from the previous month did not clear the bank account in the current month, the check will remain on the list of outstanding checks. As a result, the bank reconciliation for the current month will again show the outstanding check amount as a subtraction from the bank statement balance.

Unfortunately, the checks for $250 and $400 reach the bank account on May 30, causing the May 30 bank account balance to be a negative $350. If the bank is eager to earn fees, its computer will process the $400 check first, followed by the $250 check. This will cause the company to incur two bank fees for the bank returning the two checks to the endorsers/payees. The company will then have to pay the endorsers/payees the amounts on the checks plus any fees their banks charged for handling the NSF checks.

If the discount is allowed it will appear on the sales invoice.", "Examples of Early Payment Discounts": "Let\u2019s assume that a company sells goods on credit and offers an early payment discount expressed as 1/10, net 30. This means that a customer is allowed to deduct 1% of the invoice amount, if payment is made within 10 days (instead of paying the full amount in 30 days). In other words, the customer saves 1% for paying 20 days early. Therefore, an invoice of $1,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30 means that the $1,000 obligation will be settled in full for $990 if it is paid within 10 days. If the customer has adequate cash or a readily available line of credit, the 1% early payment discount for paying 20 days early equates to a very attractive annualized rate of approximately 18%.

Under the direct write-off method, bad debts expense is first reported on a company\u2019s income statement when a customer\u2019s account is actually written off. Often this occurs many months after the credit sale was made and is done with an entry that debits Bad Debts Expense and credits Accounts Receivable. With the direct write-off method, there is no contra asset account such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Therefore the entire balance in Accounts Receivable will be reported as a current asset on the company\u2019s balance sheet. As a result, the balance sheet is likely to report an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected. It can also result in the Bad Debts Expense being reported on the income statement in the year after the year of the sale. For these reasons, the accounting profession does not allow the direct write-off method for financial reporting. Instead, the allowance method is to be used for the financial statements. However, the direct write-off method must be used for U.S. income tax reporting. Apparently the Internal Revenue Service does not want a company reducing its taxable income by anticipating an estimated amount of bad debts expense (which is what happens when using the allowance method).", "Definition of Annualizing": "Annualizing means taking a partial year amount and converting it to a full year amount. We will use several examples to illustrate how this works.", "Definition of Irrevocable Letter of Credit": "An irrevocable letter of credit is a financial instrument used by banks to guarantee a buyer\u2019s obligations to a seller. It is irrevocable because the letter of credit cannot be modified unless all parties agree to the modifications. Irrevocable letters of credit are often used to facilitate international trade because of the additional risks involved. The irrevocable letter of credit assures the seller that it will be paid by the bank if the buyer fails to pay. Also see our related post: What is a letter of credit? Note that the irrevocable letter of credit is different from a line of credit. ", "Definition of Selling Price": "A selling price is the amount that a customer will pay to buy a product. If a retailer wants to earn a positive gross margin (or gross profit percentage), the selling price must include an additional amount that is added to the retailer\u2019s cost of the product. This additional amount must be sufficient to cover the retailer\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses and some profit.", "Example of Computing a Selling Price": "Let\u2019s use the following information:", "Definition of Job Order Costing": "Job order costing or job costing is a system for assigning and accumulating manufacturing costs of an individual unit of output. The job order costing system is used when the various items produced are sufficiently different from each other and each has a significant cost. (When a company\u2019s output consists of continuous flows of identical, low-cost units, the process costing system is more appropriate.) Since there is a significant variation in the items manufactured, the job order costing system requires a separate job cost record for each item (or each job or special order). The job cost record will report each item\u2019s direct materials and direct labor that were actually used and an assigned amount of manufacturing overhead. The job cost records also serve as the subsidiary ledger or documentation for the manufacturer\u2019s cost of the work-in-process inventory, the finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold.", "Examples of Job Order Costing": "A few examples of the use of job order costing are:", "Definition of Cost Accounting": "Cost accounting is involved with the following:", "Examples of Cost Accounting": "A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer\u2019s products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems. Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc. Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more. Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer\u2019s check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.", "Definition of Conversion Costs": "Conversion costs are the two categories of manufacturing costs that are needed to convert the direct materials into products:", "Examples of Conversion Costs": "An example of direct labor are the employees working on the assembly line of a manufacturer.

When the products are sold, the costs assigned to those products (including the manufacturing salaries and wages) are included in the cost of goods sold, which is reported on the income statement. (The costs of the products that are not sold are reported as inventory on the balance sheet. Hence, the inventory will contain some of the manufacturing salaries and wages. The salaries and wages of people in the nonmanufacturing functions such as selling, general administrative, etc. are reported directly on the current income statement as expenses in the period in which they were earned by the employees.", "Reporting of Inventory on Financial Statements": "Inventory is an asset and its ending balance is reported in the current asset  section of a company\u2019s balance sheet. Inventory is not an income statement account. However, the change in inventory is a component in the calculation of the Cost of Goods Sold, which is often presented on a company\u2019s income statement. An increase in inventory will be subtracted from a company\u2019s purchases of goods, while a decrease in inventory will be added to a company\u2019s purchase of goods to arrive at the cost of goods sold.  [Rather than simply showing the change in inventory as an adjustment to cost of goods, some income statements will show the calculation of Cost of Goods Sold as Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases = Goods Available \u2013 Ending Inventory.]", "Example of Presenting the Cost of Goods Sold Calculation": "Assume that a company\u2019s beginning inventory was $100 and its ending inventory was $110, which is an increase of 10. Let\u2019s assume that a company purchased $1,000 of goods during the accounting period. A common method of presenting the calculation of the cost of goods sold on the income statement is: Purchases of $1,000 minus the increase in inventory of $10 = $990. It is common for textbooks to show this calculation of the cost of goods sold on an income statement: Beginning Inventory of $100 + Purchases of $1,000 = Cost of Goods Available of $1,100 \u2013 Ending Inventory of $110 = $990. Hence, both presentations show the cost of goods sold of $990.", "Recap": "Again, inventory is a current asset that is reported on the balance sheet. The change in inventory is used to adjust the amount of purchases in order to report the cost of the goods that were actually sold. If some of the purchases were added to inventory, they are not part of the cost of goods sold.", "Definition of Manufacturing Costs": "Manufacturing costs are the costs of materials plus the costs to convert the materials into products. All manufacturing costs must be assigned to the units produced in order for a company\u2019s external financial statements to comply with U.S. GAAP. The resulting unit costs are used for inventory valuation and for the calculation of the cost of goods sold.", "Example of Manufacturing Costs": "Manufacturing costs are typically divided into three categories: ", "Definition of Equivalent Unit of Production": "An equivalent unit of production is an expression of the amount of work done by a manufacturer on units of output that are partially completed at the end of an accounting period. Basically the fully completed units and the partially completed units are expressed in terms of fully completed units. Equivalent units are used in the production cost reports for the producing departments of manufacturers using a process costing system. Cost accounting textbooks are likely to present the cost calculations per equivalent unit of production under two cost flow assumptions: weighted-average and FIFO.", "Example of Equivalent Units of Production": "Assume that a manufacturer uses direct labor continuously in one of its production departments. During June, the department began with no units in inventory and then started and completed 10,000 units. In addition, it started 1,000 units but they were only 30% complete at the end of June. The production cost report for this department will indicate that it manufactured 10,300 (10,000 + 300) equivalent units of product during June. If the department\u2019s direct labor cost was $103,000 during the month, it\u2019s June direct labor cost per equivalent unit will be $10 ($103,000 divided by 10,300 equivalent units). This means that $100,000 (10,000 X $10) of labor costs will be assigned to the finished units and $3,000 (300 equivalent units X $10 labor cost per equivalent unit) will be assigned to the 1,000 partially completed units.", "Formula for Calculating a Retailer\u2019s Cost of Goods Sold": "A retailer\u2019s cost of goods sold is:", "Example of Calculating a Retailer\u2019s Cost of Goods Sold": "Assume that a retailer\u2019s information includes: net purchases including freight-in is $450,000; beginning inventory had a cost of $50,000; ending inventory had a cost of $60,000. Using the above information the cost of goods sold is $440,000. One calculation is: beginning inventory of $50,000 + net purchases of $450,000 = cost of goods available of $500,000 \u2013 $60,000 of ending inventory = cost of goods sold of $440,000. The other calculation is: net purchases of $450,000 minus the increase in inventory of $10,000 = the cost of goods sold of $440,000. When there is inflation, the retailer must also elect a cost flow assumption in order to determine the cost of the ending inventory, which of course is a factor in the calculation of the cost of goods sold.", "Definition of EOQ": "EOQ is the acronym for economic order quantity. The economic order quantity is the optimum quantity of an item to be purchased at one time in order to minimize the combined annual costs of ordering and carrying the item in inventory. EOQ is also referred to as the optimum lot size. The formula to calculate the economic order quantity (EOQ) is the square root of [(2 times the annual demand in units times the incremental cost to process an order) divided by (the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory)].", "Example of EOQ Calculation": "Assume that a company has steady demand of 12,000 units per year for one of its products. The company purchases the product from its supplier at a cost of $100 each. The company\u2019s incremental cost to process an order is $144 and its incremental annual cost to carry the product in inventory is $16 per unit. EOQ = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 units of annual demand X $144 the incremental cost to process an order) / $16 the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory] = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 X $144) / $16] = the square root of [$3,456,000 / $16] = square root of 216,000 units = 465 units (rounded to a whole unit).", "Definition of Standard Cost": "A standard cost is described as a predetermined cost, an estimated future cost, an expected cost, a budgeted unit cost, a forecast cost, or as the \u201cshould be\u201d cost.

For example, if a company is constructing an addition to its building and the work is only partially completed, the amount spent so far would be recorded as Work-in-Progress, Construction in Progress, or Construction Work-in-Progress (CWIP) and the account would be on the balance sheet as a long-term asset in the section entitled Property, Plant and Equipment. When the project is completed and put into service, the amount would be transferred out of CWIP and would be reported in the account Buildings within Property, Plant and Equipment. At that point, the depreciation of the addition will begin. (If a company is constructing an assembly line or a huge machine that will take time to build, the amounts would also be accumulated in CWIP. When the project is completed and is placed into service, the amount will be transferred from CWIP to Equipment and depreciation will begin.) To complicate matters, companies that produce items under a long-term contract will use an account entitled Construction-in-Process.

Keep in mind that the sender of a message might not realize that there are important differences between slightly different terms.", "Definition of Gross Profit Method": "The gross profit method is a technique for estimating the amount of ending inventory. The gross profit method might be used to estimate each month\u2019s ending inventory or it might be used as part of a calculation to determine the approximate amount of inventory that has been lost due to theft, fire, or other reasons. The gross profit method of estimating ending inventory assumes that the gross profit percentage or the gross margin ratio is known. For example, if a company purchases goods for $80 and sells them for $100, its gross profit is $20. This results in a gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio of 20% of the selling price. Therefore, when the company has sales of $50,000 it is assumed that its cost of those goods will be $40,000 (80% of $50,000 in sales; or sales of $50,000 minus $10,000 of gross profit).  ", "Example of Gross Profit Method": "Assume you need to estimate the cost of a company\u2019s July 31 inventory. The last time the inventory was calculated was seven months earlier on December 31 when it had a cost of $15,000. Since December 31, the company purchased goods having a cost of $42,000; its sales were $50,000; and the gross profit percentage has remained at 20% (hence its cost of goods sold would be 80% of sales). The inventory at the end of the day on July 31 is estimated as follows:", "Definition of Normal Costing": "Normal costing for manufactured products consists of following:", "Examples of Managerial Accounting Topics": "Managerial accounting topics often include:", "Definitions of FIFO and LIFO": "FIFO and LIFO are two of the cost flow assumptions used by U.S. companies with inventory items. FIFO moves the first/oldest costs from inventory and reports them as the cost of goods sold and leaves the last/more recent costs in inventory. LIFO moves the latest/more recent costs from inventory and reports them as the cost of goods sold and leaves the first/oldest costs in inventory. A U.S. company may switch from FIFO to LIFO. However, after the switch the company must use LIFO consistently. ", "Reason for Using FIFO Instead of LIFO": "If a U.S. corporation\u2019s cost of inventory items are continuously increasing and the corporation has been experiencing operating losses and negative taxable income, the use of FIFO means matching its oldest/lower costs with its current sales. The result is a larger gross profit and a positive operating income.", "Reason for Using LIFO": "If a U.S. corporation\u2019s costs of inventory items are continuously increasing, a profitable U.S. corporation will have lower income tax payments with LIFO. This results from matching the most recent higher costs of its items to the most recent sales. (The higher cost of goods sold means lower net income and lower taxable income than FIFO.) Another reason for a company to use the LIFO cost flow assumption is to improve the matching of costs with sales. If the company had matched the old low costs using FIFO, the company would show a greater profit that was partly caused by merely holding some old inventory items.", "Definition of FIFO": "FIFO (which is the acronym for First In, First Out) is a cost flow assumption in which the oldest costs of inventory items are the first costs to be removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold. As a result, the most recent costs remain in inventory.", "Example of FIFO ": "Let\u2019s assume that a company sold only one product and had 10 units on hand at the beginning of the accounting year with a cost of $19 each. During the year the company purchased an additional 145 units in this order: 40 units at $20, 50 units at $21, and 55 units at $22. Let\u2019s also assume that the company uses the periodic inventory system, the FIFO cost flow assumption and that 130 units were sold. Therefore, there will be 25 units remaining in inventory. With the FIFO cost flow assumption, the first costs to come out of inventory and become the cost of goods sold are: 10@$19 + 40@$20 + 50@$21 + 30@$22. The costs that remain in inventory will be 25@$22.", "Definition of Production Costs": "In managerial accounting and cost accounting, production costs are the costs that occur in the manufacturing facilities. Production costs are also referred to as manufacturing costs, product costs, and a manufacturer\u2019s inventoriable costs.", "Examples of Production Costs": "A manufacturer\u2019s production costs consists of the costs for the following:", "Gross Profit Method Definition": "The gross profit method is a technique used to estimate the amount of ending inventory. The technique could be used for monthly financial statements when a physical inventory is not feasible. (However, it is no substitute for an annual physical inventory.) It is also used to estimate the amount of missing inventory caused by theft, fire or other disaster.", "Gross Profit Method Calculation": "Here\u2019s how the gross profit method formula works. First you must determine the gross profit percentage (gross profit margin) that your company is currently experiencing. For example, if a retailer buys its merchandise for $0.70 and sells the merchandise for $1.00, it has a gross profit of $0.30. The gross profit of $0.30 divided by the selling price of $1.00 means a gross profit margin of 30% of sales. This also means that the retailer\u2019s cost of goods sold is 70% of sales. Next, compute the sales value of the merchandise sold since the last time an inventory amount was known. Let\u2019s assume that the sales amounted to $100,000. Given the sales value of $100,000 the cost of the goods sold should be approximately $70,000 (70% from above times $100,000). Add the cost of the goods purchased since the last inventory to that inventory amount. Let\u2019s assume that previous inventory amount was $15,000 and that there were purchases of $75,000. That means the cost of goods that were available for sale totals $90,000 ($15,000 + $75,000). Since the estimated cost of goods sold was $70,000 (from above), the estimated cost of goods in inventory should be approximately $20,000 ($90,000 minus $70,000). Be certain that the gross profit percentage is indicative of reality and remember that the resulting amount is an estimate.", "Definition of Work-in-process Inventory": "Work-in-process (WIP) inventory pertains to the goods for which the manufacturing has begun, but not yet completed. In other words, WIP is the items on the factory floor.  Work-in-process inventory is also the general ledger account that reports the cost of the goods that are on the factory floor. In this current asset account are the cost of the direct materials, direct labor and the allocation of manufacturing overhead for the goods on the factory floor. In a perpetual inventory system, when the goods in WIP are completed, their cost will be moved from the WIP account into the Finished Goods Inventory account. The cost of a manufacturer\u2019s work-in-process inventory are to be disclosed in the company\u2019s financial statements.", "Example of Work-in-Process Inventory": "Generally, the amounts in work-in-process (WIP) are relatively small compared to a manufacturer\u2019s cost of goods sold and its finished goods inventory.", "Definition of Inventory Shrinkage": "Inventory shrinkage is a term to describe the loss of inventory. The shrinkage could be the result of theft, breakage, poor recordkeeping, etc. The term shrinkage may also be used by manufacturers to describe the loss of raw materials during their production processes. This shrinkage is also known as spoilage or waste and it can be either normal or abnormal.", "Example of Inventory Shrinkage": "Assume that a retailer\u2019s computerized inventory records indicates that 961 units of Product X are on hand. However, a physical count of Product X indicates that only 891 units are on hand. The difference of 70 units is the inventory shrinkage. The retailer\u2019s inventory shrinkage might be due to shoplifting, employee theft, discarding defective units without preparing the necessary paperwork for updating the computerized records,  etc. A manufacturer of baked food items will experience some shrinkage throughout its processes due to ingredients being of a lesser quality, ingredients adhering to the beaters and bowls, evaporation, less experienced bakers, etc. ", "Definition of Safety Stock": "Safety stock is an additional quantity of an item held by a company in inventory in order to reduce the risk that the item will be out of stock. Safety stock acts as a buffer in case the sales of an item are greater than planned and/or the company\u2019s supplier is unable to deliver additional units at the expected time. If the company is a manufacturer, a safety stock of materials could minimize the risk of production being disrupted.   Of course there are additional holding or carry costs associated with safety stock. However, the holding costs could be less than the cost of not filing a customer\u2019s order on time or having to stop its production line.", "Example of Safety Stock": "Assume that a company uses the economic order quantity (EOQ) model to determine the amount of product or materials it orders. Since the model requires an assumption (estimate) of annual demand, there is a risk that demand will be greater than the estimate used. Let\u2019s say that the company\u2019s EOQ is 1,000 units. As a precaution, the company may decide to always have an additional 100 units on hand as its safety stock. If demand is not constant, the company could increase the quantity of its safety stock during its peak sales periods and then reduce the quantity during periods of low sales.", "Inflation and the Cost of Goods Sold": "Generally speaking, a company selling goods during periods of inflation will see an increase in its cost of goods sold. When and by how much will depend on the cost flow assumption that is used. In the U.S., there are several cost flow assumptions available. However, a company must select one and then use it consistently. Below is an overview of three cost flow assumptions and how they affect the cost of goods sold. (However, the cost flow assumption will also affect the company\u2019s inventory valuation, as well as its gross profit, net income, income tax payments, and more.)", "More on FIFO": "Since FIFO (first-in, first out) is moving the older/lower costs to the cost of goods sold, the recent/higher costs are in inventory. The lower cost of goods sold generally results in larger amounts of gross profit, net income, taxable income, income tax payments, and certain financial ratios.  Economists may state that the larger profits using FIFO are illusory since the goods (that were sold) will have to be replaced at higher, current costs. To avoid paying income taxes on these illusory or phantom profits, many U.S. companies have switched from FIFO to LIFO.", "More on LIFO": "Since LIFO (last-in, first out) is moving the recent/higher costs to the cost of goods sold, the older/lower costs remain in inventory. The higher cost of goods sold generally results in smaller amounts of gross profit, net income taxable income, income tax payments, and certain financial ratios. Economists feel more comfortable with LIFO since the cost of goods sold is closer to the replacement costs of the goods. The smaller amount of gross profit being reported on the income statement from using LIFO eliminates much of the illusory profit and brings attention to the need to increase selling prices or take other action to maintain its same level of profits. Avoiding paying income taxes on the illusory profits gives the company some of the money that will be required to replace the goods at the new inflated costs. Keep in mind that these are general comments. You should always determine the specific facts for your situation and should consult with a professional accountant and tax adviser.", "Difference between LIFO and FIFO": "If there were no changes in the cost of inventory items (purchased or manufactured), there would be no difference between the LIFO and FIFO cost flows. Since costs have historically increased, the latest or most recent costs are higher than the older costs. When the recent higher costs are removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement, the resulting gross profit will be lower. If the corporation ends up with lower taxable income, it likely means lower income tax expense.

ABC began on January 2 and purchased 1 unit of product in each of the following months at these costs: $10 in January, $12 in April, $13 in October. Therefore, ABC\u2019s cost of goods available amounted to $35. Next, assume that 2 units were sold and 1 is in inventory on December 31. Also assume that the retail price remained constant at $16 each. Using the LIFO cost flow assumption, the cost of the 2 units sold will be $25 ($13 + $12)\nUsing the FIFO cost flow assumption, the cost of the 2 units sold will be $22 ($10 + $12) Gross profit using LIFO: Sales of $32 \u2013 COGS $25 = $7\nGross profit using FIFO: Sales of $32 \u2013 COGS $22 = $10   Note that the LIFO gross profit is $3 less than the FIFO gross profit.", "Definition of Product Cost per Unit": "In accounting, a product\u2019s cost is defined as the direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Other costs such as advertising, preparing invoices, delivery expense, office salaries, office rent and utilities, and interest on loans are examples of expenses that are not assigned to the products. Instead, these costs are described as period costs since they are expensed immediately in the accounting period in which they were incurred. Of course for a company to be profitable, it must have sufficient sales revenues (quantity and prices) to cover both the product costs of the units sold\u00a0and the other expenses of the accounting period.", "Example of Product Cost per Unit": "The product cost per unit is used for valuing a company\u2019s inventory and for determining the cost of goods sold. Since some of the manufacturing overhead costs are fixed in total (manufacturing rent, depreciation, managers\u2019 salaries, repairs, etc.), the per unit cost of\u00a0a product depends on the number of units manufactured during a given year. In other words, the cost of a product is not known with precision, even though accountants will compute the per unit cost to the nearest penny.", "Definition of Materials Usage Variance": "The materials usage variance (in a standard costing system) results from using more or less than the standard quantity of direct materials that should have been used for the actual goods produced. If the actual quantity of the materials used was more than the standard quantity allowed for the good output, the materials usage variance is unfavorable and the general ledger account Materials Usage Variance will have a debit balance. If the actual quantity of the materials used was less than the standard quantity allowed for the good output, the variance is favorable and the Materials Usage Variance account will have a credit balance. While using standard costs is helpful for planning and controlling a company\u2019s operations, the company\u2019s actual costs must be used to prepare its external financial statements.", "Example of Materials Usage Variance": "Even though a company uses a standard cost system in its accounting, the company\u2019s external financial statements must comply with the historical cost principle. In other words, the external financial statement cannot simply report what the costs should have been (the standard cost). This means that the debit or credit balance in the Materials Usage Variance account must be included in the external financial statements. If the standard quantity of the materials that should have been used was realistic (attainable) but the actual quantity exceeded the standard quantity due to inefficiencies, the materials usage variance will have to be reported on the income statement as an addition to the standard amount of the Cost of Goods Sold or as a separate line item (in the period when the inefficiencies occurred). Since companies have multiple inventory turnovers each year, small balances in the variance accounts (for whatever reason) are generally combined with the standard amount of the cost of goods sold. Significant variances which are not caused by inefficiencies may have to be divided between the work-in-process inventory, the finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold.

You simply subtract the cost of the items that are in inventory from the costs shown in the perpetual inventory system. If the perpetual inventory method is not used (or it is not maintained properly) you can determine the cost of the missing inventory with the following steps:", "Definition of Cost to Store Inventory": "The cost to store, hold or carry inventory is the total of the following:", "Example of Cost to Store Inventory": "A company estimated its annual cost to carry an additional increment of inventory to be 15% of the item\u2019s cost. This estimate was based on four components listed in the above definition. The cost of each of the components will likely be different for each company and the cost will likely vary over time.  Some of the costs are not easy to compute, but can be substantial. For example, the cost of holding items can be significant if the items become obsolete due to breakthroughs in technology. If the company cuts back on the quantity of goods it orders or the quantity of goods it produces in order to reduce its holding costs, the company will incur additional ordering costs or production set up costs.  ", "Definition of LIFO Layer": "LIFO is the acronym for Last-In, First-Out. In the context of inventory, it means that the cost of the most recently purchased units will be the first costs to be matched with the recent sales on the income statement. (The oldest costs will remain in inventory.) When the end of the year quantity of inventory increases, the cost of the recently added units becomes a new layer\u2014another LIFO layer. If the end of the year inventory quantity decreases, LIFO layers are \u201cpeeled away\u201d starting with the latest (most recent) layer first. We will illustrate this with the following example.", "Example of LIFO Layers": "Jay Corp. began operations in 2021  using the LIFO cost flow assumption. It ended the year 2021 with 10 units in inventory at a cost of $20 each. Therefore, its LIFO inventory consisted of one layer (its base layer) having a cost of $200. During 2022 Jay Corp. purchased 100 units at $21 each and sold 95 units. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, it is assumed that the 95 units sold had the most recent cost of $21 (even if the most recently purchased units were not physically shipped out to customers). The LIFO cost flow assumption results in the cost of the 10 units from 2021 remaining in inventory (10 X $20 = $200) and an additional layer being added in 2022. The 2022 LIFO layer will be the 2022 cost of 5 units (5 X $21 = $105). The LIFO inventory cost at the end of 2022 will be the 2021 LIFO base layer of $200 + the 2022 LIFO layer of $105\u2026for a total LIFO inventory cost of $305. Next, let\u2019s assume that in 2023 Jay Corp. purchased 100 units at $22 and sells 102 units. The LIFO cost flow assumption is that the 102 units sold would consist of the cost of the recently purchased 100 units at $22 plus the cost of 2 units purchased in 2022 at $21 each. In other words, Jay Corp. had to peel away part of the 2022 layer since that was the most recently added layer. This means the LIFO cost of inventory at the end of 2023 will consist of the 2021 LIFO base layer of 10 units at $20 each + the 2022 LIFO layer having 3 units at their 2022 cost of $21 each\u2026for a total LIFO inventory cost at the end of 2023 of $263 ($200 + $63). If Jay Corp. increases its inventory during 2024 by 4 units at a cost of $22 each, a new 2024 LIFO layer of 4 units will be added. The LIFO cost for the inventory at the end of 2024 will be the following: the 2021 base layer (10 units at the 2021 cost of $20 each) + the 2022 LIFO layer (3 units at the 2022 cost of $21 each) + the 2024 LIFO layer (4 units at the 2024 cost of $22 each).", "Definition of Reorder Point": "The reorder point is the quantity of units in inventory at which time an order should be placed to purchase additional units. The reorder point is calculated by using the following information:", "Example of the Reorder Point": "Assume that a company has determined that the reorder point for its Product X is 80 units and its economic order quantity is 400 units. When the inventory level of Product X drops to 80 units, the company places an order for 400 units. The 80 units should be sufficient for meeting its sales (and maintaining some additional units as safety stock) until the 400 units arrive.", "Definition of Book Depreciation": "Book depreciation is the amount recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger accounts and reported on the company\u2019s  financial statements. This depreciation is based on the matching principle of accounting. ", "Example of Book Depreciation": "Let\u2019s assume that equipment used in a business has a cost of $500,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years. If the company assumes no salvage value at the end of the 10 years, the annual depreciation expense recorded in the general ledger accounts and reported on the financial statements will likely be $50,000 each year. Each year the company is matching $50,000 of the equipment\u2019s cost to that year\u2019s revenues that are earned because of the equipment.", "Definition of Tax Depreciation": "Tax depreciation refers to the amounts reported on the company\u2019s income tax returns and in the U.S. the tax depreciation is based on the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The tax regulations specify the useful life of assets but also allow for accelerated depreciation or the immediate expensing of certain amounts on some companies\u2019 tax returns. There is no regulation that requires the tax depreciation to be the same as the book depreciation in a given year. (However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense for both will be limited to the asset\u2019s cost.)", "Example of Tax Depreciation": "Assuming the company purchases equipment of $500,000 the IRS regulations may require that the equipment be depreciated over 7 years and allows an accelerated method of depreciation. In some years the regulations may allow certain companies to charge the entire equipment\u2019s cost to depreciation in the first year. These regulations result in a company having larger depreciation deductions sooner and therefore receiving the income tax savings sooner. You can learn more about tax depreciation from www.IRS.gov or from a tax adviser.", "Difference Between Book and Tax Depreciation": "Generally, the difference between book depreciation and tax depreciation involves the \u201ctiming\u201d of when the cost of an asset will appear as depreciation expense on a company\u2019s financial statements versus the depreciation expense on the company\u2019s income tax return. Hence, the depreciation expense in each year will likely be different, but the total of all of the years\u2019 depreciation expense for an asset will likely add up to the same total.  The difference between book and tax depreciation leads some people to say, \u201cOh, the company has two sets of books.\u201d The fact is the company must 1) maintain depreciation records for the financial statement depreciation that is based on the matching principle, and also 2) maintain depreciation records for the tax return depreciation that is based on the IRS rules.", "Definition of Asset Salvage Value": "In accounting, an asset\u2019s salvage value is the estimated amount that a company will receive at the end of a plant asset\u2019s useful life. It is the amount of an asset\u2019s cost that will not be part of the depreciation expense during the years that the asset is used in the business. Salvage value is also referred to as disposal value, residual value, or scrap value. ", "Example of Asset Salvage Value": "Perhaps the most common calculation of an asset\u2019s salvage value is to assume there will be no salvage value. As a result, the entire cost of the asset used in the business will be charged to depreciation expense during the years of the asset\u2019s expected useful life. A salvage value of zero is reasonable since it is assumed that the asset will no longer be useful at the point when the depreciation expense ends. Even if the company receives a small amount, it may be offset by costs of removing and disposing of the asset.", "Definition of Scrap Value": "In cost accounting, scrap value refers to a relatively insignificant amount that a manufacturer receives from the sale of production materials that remain after the manufacture of its products.  In financial accounting, the term scrap value might be used instead of the more common terms of salvage value, disposal value, or residual value when calculating the depreciation of an asset used in the business. In this situation, scrap value is the expected or estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.", "Examples of Scrap Value": "A manufacturer of aluminum products melts aluminum. In the process it separates out small amounts of aluminum containing impurities. The relatively small amount of money that the manufacturer receives for the impure aluminum is known as the scrap value. For examples of scrap value that is meant to be the disposal, residual, or salvage value of a plant asset, see our major topic Depreciation. ", "Definition of Amortization": "In general, the word amortization means to systematically reduce a balance over time. In accounting, amortization is conceptually similar to the depreciation of a plant asset or the depletion of a natural resource.", "Examples of Amortization": "Perhaps the most common example of the term amortization is the amortization schedule associated with a mortgage loan. For a 15-year mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate and monthly payments, the amortization schedule shows the same total amount for each of the monthly payments. However, since each month\u2019s principal payment reduces the loan\u2019s principal balance, the next month\u2019s interest payment will be slightly less and the principal payment slightly more. In addition to the amortization schedule for loans payable and loans receivable, accountants use the term  amortization to mean the systematic allocation of an asset or liability amount from the balance sheet to expense (or revenue) on the income statement. Here are a few examples:", "Purpose of Depreciation": "The purpose of depreciation is to achieve the matching principle of accounting. That is, a company is attempting to match the historical cost of a productive asset (that has a useful life of more than a year) to the revenues earned from using the asset. Since it is difficult to precisely match a productive asset\u2019s cost to a company\u2019s revenues, the asset\u2019s cost is usually allocated to the years in which the asset is used. In other words, depreciation systematically moves the asset\u2019s cost from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement over the asset\u2019s useful life. Accountants point out that depreciation is an allocation process which does not result in reporting the asset\u2019s market value.", "Example of Recording Depreciation": "The accounting entry to record depreciation is:", "Definition of Direct and Indirect Costs": "The depreciation expense associated with the asset can be direct cost or an indirect cost or both a direct and indirect cost. Direct costs are traceable to a cost object (department, product, etc.) without any allocation. Indirect costs must be allocated to a cost object since the cost is not traceable to the cost object.", "Example of Depreciation Being a Direct Cost and/or an Indirect Cost": "Assume a company has a variety of manufacturing departments, one of which is the Finishing Department. The Finishing Department\u2019s equipment is used for producing only one product line, which has three different versions (basic, deluxe, and premier). Each of the three versions uses a different amount of the equipment\u2019s time. The depreciation of the equipment is a direct cost to the Finishing Department. It is a direct cost because the equipment is used exclusively in the Finishing Department, and therefore does not require any allocation to get it to that cost object. If the annual depreciation on the equipment in the Finishing Departments is $60,000 a year, the $60,000 is a direct cost of the Finishing Department. The depreciation of the equipment is also an indirect cost of the products using the equipment. It is an indirect cost because the company has to allocate the depreciation to the three versions of the product line that are processed in the Finishing Department. Let\u2019s assume that the allocation is based on the amount of the equipment\u2019s time that was used. If the equipment will operate for 6,000 hours a year, the depreciation could be allocated to the products using the Finishing Department\u2019s equipment at the rate of $10 per hour ($60,000/6,000 hours). If the basic version of the product requires 1 hour, each basic version will be allocated $10. If the deluxe version requires 2 hours, each deluxe version will be allocated $20.  Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, or burden.", "Definition of Units-of-Activity Depreciation": "The units-of-activity depreciation is unique among the common methods of depreciation in that the useful life of the asset being depreciated is not expressed or calculated based on the passage of time (such as years). Instead, the depreciation is expressed and calculated based on the asset\u2019s usage. Under the units-of-activity method of depreciation, the asset\u2019s cost (less any salvage value) is allocated to the accounting periods based on the asset\u2019s usage (units produced, activity, etc.) during each of the accounting periods. (Hence, the number of years, partial years, passage of time, etc. are not relevant with the units-of-activity method of depreciation.) ", "Example of Units-of-Activity Depreciation": "Assume that a company acquires a robot that is expected to be useful for performing a simple operation on 100,000 units of product. The robot has a cost of $225,000 and is expected to have a salvage value of $25,000 at the end of the 100,000 operations. Under the units-of-activity method, the company will record $2 of depreciation for every robot operation. (Cost of $225,000 \u2013 $25,000 of expected salvage value divided by the expected 100,000 operations.) In an accounting year when 8,000 robot operations occur, the depreciation will be $16,000. In a year when 23,000 operations occur, the depreciation will be $46,000. The robot depreciation will continue until a total of $200,000 of depreciation has been taken (and the book value will be $25,000). The units of activity method of depreciation is also referred to as the units-of-production method.", "What Accumulated Depreciation Tells Us": "An asset\u2019s accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the asset\u2019s cost to indicate the asset\u2019s book value. The book value indicates the maximum amount of future depreciation remaining. Since depreciation is defined as the allocation of an asset\u2019s cost based on the estimated useful life, the book value of the asset is not an indication of the asset\u2019s market value. For example, a building in an excellent location may be increasing in value even though the accumulated depreciation is increasing and therefore the book value is decreasing. The amount reported in the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation merely reports the total amount of an asset\u2019s cost that has been moved to the income statement in the form of depreciation expense since the asset was acquired.", "Definition of Mid-Month Convention": "In depreciation, the\u00a0mid-month convention means that an asset placed into service\u00a0anytime during a given month is assumed to have been placed into\u00a0service in the middle of that month. As a result, there will be one-half month of depreciation in that month.  The same is true for the disposal of an asset. There will be one-half month of depreciation in the month of the disposal. The mid-month\u00a0convention is pertinent for the income tax depreciation for\u00a0certain property.\u00a0 You can find more on this in the Internal Revenue Service Publication 946.", "Examples of Mid-Month Convention": "Under the mid-month convention, if a company put a warehouse into service on October\u00a06, it is assumed that the warehouse was put into service\u00a0in the middle of October and there should be one-half month of depreciation in October. If a building is placed\u00a0into service on October\u00a023, it is assumed that the building was put into service\u00a0in the middle of October. This also means there should be one-half month of depreciation for October. If a company disposes of an asset on October 25, it is assumed to have been disposed\u00a0of in the middle of October and one-half month of depreciation is taken for October. If an asset is\u00a0disposed of on October 3, it is also\u00a0assumed that the asset was disposed of\u00a0in the middle of October and one-half month of depreciation is taken for October.", "Definition of Biweekly Payroll": "Biweekly payroll refers to paydays that occur 26 times per year (52 weeks in a year divided by 2 weeks = 26 times per year).

Debt financing often comes with strict conditions or covenants regarding interest and principal payments, maintaining certain financial ratios, and more.

Let\u2019s also assume that after the bonds are issued the market interest rates increase by one percentage point. As a result the 5% bond will lose some of its value because the contractual payment of $50 per year is not worth $1,000 when the market is paying $60 per year for a similar $1,000 bond. An investor will purchase the 5% bond only if the cost is low enough to yield 6% over the remaining life of the bond. In other words, the investor will pay less than the $1,000 so that the effective interest rate for the remaining life of the bond will be 6%.", "Definition of Amortization of Premium on Bonds Payable": "The amortization of the premium on bonds payable is the systematic movement of the amount of premium received when the corporation issued the bonds. The premium was received because the bonds\u2019 stated interest rate was greater than the market interest rate. The amount of the premium is recorded in a separate bond-related liability account. Over the life of the bonds the premium amount will be systematically moved to the income statement as a reduction of Bond Interest Expense.", "Example of Amortization of Premium on Bonds Payable": "Assume that a corporation issues bonds payable having a maturity value of $1,000,000 and receives a premium of $60,000. The bonds mature in 20 years and there was no accrued interest at the time the bonds are issued. The corporation will record the bonds as follows:", "Definition of Bond Premium": "Bond premium or premium on bonds occurs when the bond\u2019s actual interest payments are greater than the interest payments expected by the market. The amount of the bond premium = (actual future interest payments + actual maturity amount) discounted by the market interest rate at the time of the bond sale. ", "Example of a Bond Premium": "A person would buy a bond at a premium (pay more than its maturity value) because the bond\u2019s stated interest rate (and therefore the bond\u2019s interest payments) will be greater than those expected by the current bond market. It is also possible that a bond investor will have no choice. For example, if the investor wants to purchase a bond with a high rating that matures in 8 years, perhaps only one bond will be available. If its stated interest rate is greater than the market interest rate on the day of the transaction, the investor either buys the bond at a premium or doesn\u2019t buy a bond.

This is caused by the bonds having a stated interest rate that is higher than the market interest rate for similar bonds.", "Example of Premium on Bonds Payable": "Assume that a corporation prepares to issue bonds having a maturity value of $10,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6%. However, when the 6% bonds are actually sold, the market interest rate is 5.9%. Since these bonds will be paying investors more than the interest required by the market ($300,000 semiannually instead of $295,000 semiannually), the investors will pay more than $10,000,000 for the bonds. If we assume the investors pay $10,150,000 for the bonds, the corporation will record the transaction with a debit to Cash of $10,150,000; a credit to Bonds Payable of $10,000,000; and a credit of $150,000 to Premium on Bonds Payable (an adjunct liability account). Over the life of the bonds, the $150,000 premium is to be accounted for as a reduction of the corporation\u2019s interest expense. This is done through the amortization of premium on bonds payable. The combination of 1) the unamortized credit balance in the account Premium on Bonds Payable, 2) the unamortized debit balance in the account Bond Issue Costs, and 3) the $10,000,000 credit balance in Bonds Payable is known as the book value or the carrying value of the bonds payable.", "Definition of Selling Price of Bond": "The selling price (or the market value) of a bond is the present value of the future contractual cash amounts that are going to be received by the owner of the bond.

This means that the bondholder will be paid interest of $2,500 every six months until the bond matures. If the current market interest rate for this type of bond is 6%, the current market value of the 5% bond will be less than $100,000. Assume that the market value for this bond is only $95,735. (The market value is computed by discounting 1) the $2,500 of interest that will be received every six months for 5 years to its present value and 2) the $100,000 maturity amount that will be received at the end of 5 years. These cash amounts are discounted by the market interest rate of 3% per semiannual period for 10 semiannnual periods.) You can also view the yield to maturity of this bond as the following two components:", "Definition of Stated Interest Rate of a Bond": "The stated interest rate of a bond payable is the annual interest rate that is printed on the face of the bond and stated in the related legal document known as the bond indenture. The stated interest rate of a bond payable is also known as the face interest rate, nominal interest rate, contractual interest rate, and the coupon interest rate. The stated interest rate multiplied by the bond\u2019s face amount (or par amount) determines the amount of cash that must be paid during each year. However, it is common for half of the annual amount to be paid at the end of each 6-month period (semiannually).  Generally, a bond\u2019s stated interest rate is fixed (does not change) for the life of the bond. As a result, the  interest payments form an ordinary annuity for the life of the bond. While the interest payments are a constant amount, the market interest rate for the bond is likely to be continually changing. A change in the market interest rate will cause the present value of the interest payments (and the present value of the maturity amount) to change in the opposite direction. For instance, when the market interest rate increases the present value of the existing bond will decrease. When the market interest rate decreases, the present value of an existing bond will increase. (The there can be some limits to the amount of the change.)", "Example of a Stated Interest Rate on a Bond": "Assume a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds having a stated interest rate of 6% and maturing in 10 years. This means that the corporation agrees to pay interest of $300,000 semiannually ($10,000,000 X 6% X 1/2 year) at the end of each of the 20 semiannual periods. At the time the bonds mature (at end of the 10 years) the corporation agrees to also pay $10,000,000. Typically, these cash amounts will not change even if there are significant changes in the market interest rates.", "Definition of Actual or Real Interest Rate on a Bond Investment": "The actual or real interest rate on a bond payable is also known as effective interest rate, yield to maturity, yield, and market interest rate. This rate can be calculated by discounting the bond\u2019s future cash amounts (semiannual interest payments and the maturity amount) back to the amount of cash paid to buy the bond (the present value).", "Example of Actual or Real Interest Rate on a Bond Investment": "Assume an investor can purchase a $300,000 7% bond that matures 5 years later for $287,832. The investor will receive the following cash flows: semiannual interest of $10,500 at the end of each of the 10 six-month periods + $300,000 at the end of the 10th six-month period. The actual interest rate to be earned by the investor (the bond\u2019s yield to maturity) is the interest rate that will discount the interest stream (an ordinary annuity) and the maturity amount (a lump sum) to $287,832. This can be done with software, a financial calculator, or via trial and error using present value tables. In our example, the actual interest rate earned by the investor is 4% per semiannual period or 8% annually.  The reason that the bond can be purchased at a discount from its face and maturity amount, is that the current market interest rate is now 8% and the bond is paying only 7%. Because the market interest rate is more than the bond\u2019s stated interest rate, the market value of the bond is less than the maturity amount.", "Definition of Amortize Premium, Discount, and Issue Costs": "With regards to bonds payable, the term amortize means to systematically allocate the discount on bonds payable, the premium on bonds payable, and bond issue costs to Interest Expense over the remaining life of the bonds. (Bonds are likely to mature 10 years or more after they are issued.) The most precise way to amortize these amounts is to use the effective interest rate method. However, the straight-line method of amortization, which is less precise and simpler is also acceptable.", "Examples of Amortizing Discount on Bonds and Bond Issue Costs": "Assume that on January 1, a corporation issues $2,000,000 of 6% Bonds Payable which mature at the end of 10 years. Because the market interest rate for similar bonds was higher than 6%, the corporation received only $1,940,000 from investors. The resulting difference of $60,000 must be recorded in the contra-liability account Discount on Bonds Payable. The corporation must also record the bond issue costs (legal, auditing and filing fees) of $24,000 in the contra-liability account Bond Issue Costs. On each June 30 and December 31, the corporation must pay interest of $60,000 ($2,000,000 X 6% X 1/2 year). The corporation must also amortize the bond discount and the bond issue costs.

Another term for ordinary annuity is annuity in arrears.", "Example of Ordinary Annuity": "The series of semiannual interest payments that are part of a bond payable is an example of an ordinary annuity.  A 10-year bond with a face value of $10 million and a stated interest rate of 6% will include an ordinary annuity consisting of the required interest payments of $300,000 at the end of each of the 20 six-month time intervals. Another example of an ordinary annuity is a mortgage loan having a fixed interest rate and a series of equal monthly payments. For instance, a 15-year mortgage loan will result in an ordinary annuity of 180 equal monthly payments with the first payment due approximately 30 days after the loan is made.", "Definition of Face Value of a Bond Payable": "The face value of a bond payable is the amount printed on the bond. The face value is also referred to as the following:", "Example of Face Value of a Bond Payable": "Assume that a corporation issues a bond payable having a face value of $1,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6% per year.

The cost of capital is expressed as a percentage and it is often used to compute the net present value of the cash flows in a proposed investment. It is also considered to be the minimum after-tax internal rate of return to be earned on new investments. For a profitable U.S. corporation, the costs of bonds and other long-term loans are usually the least expensive components of the cost of capital. One reason is that the interest is deductible for income taxes. For example, a corporation paying 6% on its loans may have an after-tax cost of 4% when its combined federal and state income tax rate is 33%. On the other hand, the dividends paid on the corporation\u2019s preferred and common stock are not tax deductible.

The board of directors would like the shares of common stock to be trading near $50. To achieve this, the board approved a 3-for-1 stock split. After the stock split there are 300,000 shares issued and outstanding. If an individual stockholder owned 10,000 shares or 10% of the 100,000 shares before the stock split, the stockholder will own 30,000 shares or 10% of the 300,000 shares after the stock split.", "Journal Entries for a Stock Split": "The only journal entry needed for a stock split is a memo entry to note that the number of shares has changed and that the par value per share has changed (if the stock has a par value).

Preferred stock is also known as preference stock. The word \u201cpreferred\u201d refers to the dividends paid by the corporation and to the liquidation of the corporation (if that were to occur). In exchange for this preferential treatment, the preferred stockholders (shareholders) generally will never receive more than the preferred stock\u2019s stated fixed dividend. The preferential treatment for dividends means that preferred stockholders will receive their dividends before the common stockholders are to receive any dividend.  Preferred stock is relatively rare since corporations will use debt in addition to its common stock.", "Example of Preferred Stock": "Assume that a stockholder owns 100 shares of a corporation\u2019s 8% $100 par preferred stock. Each year, this stockholder must receive dividends on the preferred stock of $800 (8% X $100 = $8 per share X 100 shares) before the common stockholders are allowed to receive any cash dividends for the year. Unless the preferred stock has a participating feature, this preferred stockholder will never receive more than $8 per share no matter how successful the corporation becomes. The preferred stock could have any of the following features: cumulative, convertible, callable, participating, and more. Since the dividend on preferred stock is usually a fixed amount forever, once the preferred stock is issued its market value is likely to change in the opposite direction of inflation. The higher the rate of inflation, the less valuable are the fixed dividend amounts.

Next month, Jones Corporation will be declaring a 10% stock dividend. This means that the corporation will distribute 10,000 (100,000 shares X 10%) new shares of common stock to its stockholders. If the market price of a share of common stock will be $25, the entry to record the stock dividend will be a debit of $250,000 to Retained Earnings and a credit to a paid-in capital account such as Common Stock.

The common stockholders elect the corporation\u2019s board of directors and will vote on certain transactions such as merging the corporation with another corporation. Generally, it is the common stockholders who become wealthy when a corporation becomes increasingly successful. In addition to common stock, some corporations also issue preferred stock. The owners of the shares\nof preferred stock are known as preferred stockholders (or preferred shareholders). The preferred stockholders usually accept a fixed cash dividend that will be paid by the corporation before the common stockholders are paid a dividend. In exchange for this preferential treatment of dividends, the preferred stockholders typically forego the potential financial gains that the common stockholders might enjoy.

Since the corporation has a limited amount of cash available, the board of directors did not declare any dividends on the preferred stock this year. In other words, the corporation has dividends in arrears of $60,000 (6% X $100 X 10,000). The preferred stock\u2019s dividends in arrears must be disclosed in the corporation\u2019s notes to its financial statements. This notifies investors and others that these past, omitted dividends must be paid before any dividends can be declared and paid. Typically, the monthly payments required for automobile and real estate loans are annuities in arrears.

For instance, a  corporation with 100,000 shares of stock before a 2-for-1 stock split will have 200,000 shares after the split. An investor owning 100 shares before the stock is split 2-for-1 will have 200 shares after the split.", "Stock Price After a Stock Split": "Since the corporation is not changed (total assets, liabilities, stockholders\u2019 equity remain the same) by the stock split, the change in the number of shares will cause a change in the market price of each share. For example, if a share had been trading at $50 before a 2-for-1 stock split, a share should be trading at $25 after the stock split. If the corporation had 100,000 shares of common stock trading at $50 per share before a 2-for-1 stock split, the total market value of the shares would have been $5 million. After the 2-for-1 stock split, the corporation\u2019s market value will also be $5 million (200,000 shares X $25 per share). This is the same for each investor. For example, the 10 shares owned by a small investor had a market value of $500 (10 shares X $50). After the 2-for-1 stock split, the small investor shares will also have a market value of $500 (20 shares X $25).", "Why Stock Splits Occur": "Stock splits such as 2-for-1, 3-for-2, 4-for-1, etc. (which increase the number of shares) are intended to decrease the market price of each share of a corporation\u2019s common stock. Often the purpose is to allow small investors to purchase 100 shares of the corporation\u2019s stock at a more reasonable total cost. Reverse stock splits such as 1-for-10 (which decrease the number of shares) are intended to increase the market price of each share of stock. Usually the purpose is to minimize the number of small investors. To illustrate, assume that a corporation had 800,000 shares of stock that were trading at $2 per share (resulting in a total market value of $1.6 million). After a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, there will be only 80,000 shares trading at $20 per share (which also results in a total market value of $1.6 million). Prior to the reverse stock split, small investors were able to purchase 100 shares for just $200.

The payback method simply computes the number of years it will take for an investment to return cash that is equal to the amount invested. The computed number of years is referred to as the payback period. To illustrate, assume that a company invests $100,000 today in a project that is expected to generate cash of $50,000 for two years followed by $10,000 per year for four additional years. Its payback period is two years ($50,000 + $50,000).  Assume that another investment of $100,000 generates cash of $20,000 per year for two years and then provides cash of $40,000 per year for six additional years, its payback period is approximately 3.5 years ($20,000 + $20,000 + $40,000 + half of $40,000). The payback method answers only one question: How long before the cash invested is returned? The payback method does not address which investment is more profitable. Note from our examples that the payback method not only ignores the time value of money, it ignores all of the cash received after the payback period. Another example of a non-discount method in capital budgeting is the accounting rate of return method, which is similar to the return on investment (ROI). [To overcome the above shortcomings, capital budgeting should include calculations that recognize the time value of money. These include (1) the net present value, and (2) the internal rate of return.

The variable expenses are estimated to be 80% of the net sales. This means that the contribution margin ratio is 20% of net sales. Since only 20% of the sales dollars are available to cover the $100,000 fixed expenses, the company will need to have $500,000 of net sales ($100,000 divided by 20%). At $500,000 of net sales, the amount of variable expenses will be $400,000 (80% X $500,000). That leaves $100,000 to cover the $100,000 of fixed expenses.

The greater the number of loaves produced, the greater the total cost of the flour used by the bakery. An example of a fixed cost is the depreciation and insurance on the bakery facility and equipment. Regardless of the quantity of artisan breads produced in a month, the total amount of depreciation and insurance cost for the month will remain the same. An example of a mixed cost or semivariable cost is the bakery\u2019s cost of natural gas. Some of the monthly gas bill is a flat fee charged by the utility and some of the gas bill is the cost of heating the building. These two components of the gas bill are fixed since they will not change when the bakery produces more or less loaves of its bread.

However, part of each monthly electricity bill is fixed because this part of the bill does not change because of the number of products manufactured. For instance, the cost of the air conditioning and air purifying occurs continuously. In addition, the electric bill includes a fixed charge based on the manufacturer\u2019s peak day electricity usage that occurred in the prior 12 months. ", "Direct Costs vs. Indirect Costs": "The terms direct costs and indirect costs could be referring to a product, a department, a machine, geographic market, etc. (which are referred to as cost objects).  If the cost object is a company\u2019s product that is being manufactured, the cost of the product\u2019s raw materials and the cost of the employees on the assembly line are direct costs since they are directly traceable to the product. However, the cost of the other employees in the manufacturing facility (maintenance, clean-up, material handlers, etc.) and the other costs of the manufacturing facility (depreciation, property tax, maintenance, heat, and insurance) are indirect product costs since these costs must be allocated to the product. These indirect product costs are also known as manufacturing overhead costs, factory overhead costs, and burden. If the cost object is the company\u2019s production department, the depreciation of the production equipment and the salary of the manager of the production department are direct costs of the production department. However, the depreciation, heat, and maintenance, etc. of the building containing the production department (which also includes the warehouse for materials, the warehouse for finished goods, the shipping department, and quality control department) are indirect costs of the production department, since they must be allocated to the production department.", "Fixed Costs vs. Variable Costs": "If the cost object is a product being manufactured, it is likely that direct materials are a variable cost. (If one pound of material is used for each unit, then this direct cost is variable.) However, the product\u2019s indirect manufacturing costs are likely a combination of fixed costs and variable costs. For instance, if the managers within the manufacturing facility but not on the assembly line are paid salaries which total $20,000 per month, this cost is a fixed indirect product cost. The equipment maintenance expense and the temporary shipping clerks could be a variable indirect product cost, since this cost will vary with production volume. If the cost object is the production department, the direct and indirect department costs are likely to be partly fixed and partly variable. For example, the production department has it own electric meter to measure the electricity used to operate its equipment. Therefore, the electricity cost is a direct production department cost that is variable since it changes with the volume of products manufactured. On the other hand the salaries of the production department supervisors are a direct production department cost that is fixed.", "Examples of Causes for an Increase in a Break-even Point": "Some of the reasons why a company\u2019s break-even point will increase are:", "Example of Contribution Margin Ratio": "Assume that a company manufactures and sells a single product and has the following information:", "Definition of High-Low Method": "The high-low method is a simple technique for determining the variable cost rate and the amount of fixed costs that are part of what\u2019s referred to as a mixed cost or semivariable cost. The high-low method uses two sets of numbers: 1) the total dollars of the mixed cost that occurred at the highest volume of activity, and 2) the total dollars of the mixed cost that occurred at the lowest volume of activity. It is assumed that at both points of activity the total amount of fixed costs is the same. Therefore, the change in the total costs is assumed to be the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity. Prior to doing the high-low calculation, it is important to plot or graph all of the data available to be certain that the two sets of numbers being used are indeed representative.", "Example of High-Low Method": "Assume that the cost of electricity at a small manufacturing facility is a mixed cost since the company has only one electricity meter for air quality, cooling, lighting, and for its production equipment. The company wants to know the rate at which its electricity cost changes when the number of machine hours change. This amount is the variable cost rate. The part of the electric bill that does not change with the number of machine hours is known as the fixed cost. Let\u2019s assume that the company is billed monthly for its electricity usage. The cost of electricity was $18,000 in the month when its highest activity was 120,000 machine hours (MHs). (Be sure to use the MHs that occurred between the meter reading dates appearing on the bill.) The cost of electricity was $16,000 in the month when its lowest activity was 100,000 MHs. This shows that the total monthly cost of electricity changed by $2,000 ($18,000 vs. $16,000) when the number of MHs changed by 20,000 (120,000 vs. 100,000). In other words, the variable cost rate was $0.10 per machine hour ($2,000/20,000 MHs). Continuing with this example, if the total electricity cost was $18,000 when there were 120,000 MHs, the variable portion is assumed to have been $12,000 (120,000 MHs times $0.10). Since the total electricity cost was $18,000 and the variable cost was calculated to be $12,000, the fixed cost of electricity for the month must have been the $6,000. If we use the lowest level of activity, the total cost of $16,000 would include $10,000 of variable cost (100,000 MHs times $0.10) with the remainder of $6,000 being the fixed cost for the month.", "Definition of Fixed Expense": "A fixed expense is an expense whose total amount does not change when there is an increase in an activity such as sales or production.

When the company produces 10,001 units, the company\u2019s total cost is $50,002. Therefore, the marginal cost of producing unit #10,001 is $2. The reason that the marginal cost was $2 instead of the previous average cost of $5 ($50,000 divided by 10,000 units) is that some costs did not increase when the additional unit was produced.

When 10 loaves are produced, the total cost of flour will be $4. If 50 loaves are produced, the cost of flour will be $20 (50 loaves X 1 pound X $0.40 per pound).

(Of course, if there is a need to double the number of machine hours, the total amount of rent will likely increase to accommodate this large increase in activity. This is why accountants say a cost is fixed only within a reasonable or relevant range of activity.) Many manufacturing overhead costs are fixed and the amounts occur in large increments. Additional examples include depreciation on a company-owned factory, depreciation on machinery and equipment, salaries and benefits of manufacturing supervisors, factory administration costs, etc. One of the challenges regarding fixed manufacturing overhead costs is the allocation or assigning of the fixed costs to the individual units of product (which likely vary in size and complexity). The allocation is referred to as absorption costing, which is required by U.S. accounting and income tax rules for valuing a manufacturer\u2019s inventories and its cost of goods sold. It is important to remember that while the fixed overhead is assigned to products on the basis of machine hour usage, this is not how the fixed costs behave or occur. For instance, the cost of the production facilities\u2019 rent might be assigned to the products at the rate of $4 per machine hour, but the rent actually occurs at the rate of $10,000 per month regardless of the number of machine hours.", "Definition of Negative Contribution Margin": "A negative contribution margin ratio indicates that a company\u2019s variable costs and expenses exceed its sales. In other words, if the company increases its sales with the same sales mix, it will experience larger losses.", "Example of Eliminating a Negative Contribution Margin": "By definition, the ways to eliminate the negative contribution margin include:", "Definition of Variable Expense": "An expense is  variable when its total amount changes in proportion to the change in sales, production, or some other activity. In other words, a variable expense increases when an activity increases, and it decreases when the activity decreases.  ", "Examples of Variable Expenses": "Assume that a website business sells a product and requires the customer to pay with a credit card. The credit card processor charges the business a fee of 3% of each amount charged. Therefore, if the business has sales of $10,000 in the month of June, the business will have a credit card expense of $300. If July\u2019s sales are $30,000 the credit card expense will be $900. The total credit card expense varies with sales because the fee has a constant rate of 3% of sales. Another example of a variable expense is a retailer\u2019s cost of goods sold. For instance, if a company purchases a product for $30 and is able to sell it for $50, the company\u2019s cost of goods sold will be a constant rate of 60% ($30 / $50). Therefore, when the company has sales of $10,000 the cost of goods will be $6,000. When the sales are $30,000 the cost of goods sold will be $18,000. Knowing how costs behave when sales or other activities change will allow you to better understand how a company\u2019s gross profit and net income will change. It also allows you to quickly calculate a product\u2019s contribution margin and to estimate the company\u2019s break-even point.", "Definition of Learning Curve": "A common learning curve shows that the cumulative average time to complete a manual task (in which learning is involved) will decrease 20% whenever the cumulative volume doubles. This common learning curve (where the cumulative average time decreases by 20%) is known as an 80% learning curve.", "Example of 80% Learning Curve": "To illustrate the 80% learning curve, let\u2019s use as an example a person learning to design and code websites of similar size and complexity. If the first website takes the person 100 hours, then after the second website the cumulative average time will be 80 hours (80% of 100 hours). This cumulative average of 80 hours consists of 100 hours for the first website plus only 60 hours for the second website resulting in a total of 160 hours divided by 2 websites = 80 hours. After the fourth website the cumulative average time for all four websites will be 64 hours (80% of 80 hours). After the eighth website the cumulative average for all 8 websites will be 51.2 hours (80% of 64 hours). In other words, the total time to have completed all eight websites will be 409.6 hours (8 websites times an average time of 51.2 hours). Improvements in technology can also result in time and cost reductions beyond those in the learning curve. For example, software may become available to assist in the design and coding, computer processing speeds might increase, there may be lower costs of processing and storage, etc. In accounting, the learning curve is important for setting standards, estimating costs, and establishing selling prices.", "What is Simple Linear Regression Analysis": "Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool for quantifying the relationship between one independent variable (hence \u201csimple\u201d) and one dependent variable based on past experience (observations).

However, the company\u2019s other expenses (executives\u2019 compensation, depreciation, general administration) will not be reduced. The $400,000 of costs that are directly associated with E are relevant costs, since the company will see its total costs decrease by $400,000 when E is eliminated.

You will have to estimate them. The same holds true for the variable costs and expenses associated with the missed revenues and the missed opportunity.   ", "Example of Calculating Opportunity Costs": "Assume that a small manufacturer has a limited number of machine hours available on its large specialized machine. The setup time to prepare the machine to run a different job is 4 hours. During these 4 hours, the company is losing the opportunity to generate profits had the machine been running. Next, assume that the machine is billed out to customers at $200 per hour and the variable costs of operating the machine are estimated to be $60 per hour. This means that when the machine is not running, the company is missing the opportunity to earn a contribution of $140 per machine hour. During the 4-hour setup time, the company is missing/losing/foregoing a contribution of $560 (4 hours X $140). In other words, the company\u2019s opportunity cost for setting up the machine is $560. A bean counter might look in the company\u2019s payroll records and say that the cost of setting up the machine is 4 hours X $40 (the hourly wage and benefits of the setup person) = $160. An astute business person would say that the real cost of having this machine idle for 4 hours X $140 (the lost hourly contribution margin) = $560. Even though opportunity cost of $560 per setup is not found in the general ledger accounts, it should be used when quoting or setting prices for using the machine. In other words, the pricing of the machine\u2019s output should begin with $560 for setting up the machine. If the company finds its prices to be higher than its competition, it should find ways to reduce the number of hours necessary to set up the machine and/or find other areas for reducing costs.", "Definition of a Favorable Budget Variance": "A favorable budget variance means that the actual amount that occurred was better for the company (or organization) than the amount that had been budgeted.

A disadvantage of decentralization occurs if a subunit makes a decision that is good for the subunit\u2019s financial results, but it results in less than optimal profits for the company as a whole.", "Examples of Decentralization": "A corporation may have several operating businesses each of which is responsible for its revenues and expenses. However, investment decisions for the operating businesses remain centralized. That is, the corporation\u2019s executive officers decide which investments will be made in the operating businesses.

The responsibility centers are often profit centers of a decentralized corporation such as related subsidiary corporations, separate divisions of a corporation, or some other subunits.  Depending on the production capacity and the demand for each subunit\u2019s goods or services, a transfer price could be based on cost, market prices, variable costs plus an opportunity cost, or some other amount. A concern with transfer pricing is whether the transfer price will cause a subunit\u2019s manager to take the action that is best for the company as a whole.", "Example of Transfer Pricing": "Assume that Giant Corporation has several subsidiary companies including Sub1 and Sub2. Sub1 manufactures electronic components that it sells to companies throughout the world. Sub2 manufactures a unique consumer gadget that uses a component that Sub1 manufactures. Sub1 sells the component for $20 to its many outside customers and its cost to manufacture the unit is $12. The transfer price is the amount that Sub2 will pay Sub 1 for each component it needs. If Sub 1 has idle capacity, it can make an additional profit even with a transfer price of less than $20. However, Sub2 will be able to sell far more of its profitable consumer gadgets if its cost of the component from Sub 1 is $16. It may be in the best interest of Giant Corporation to arrange for both Sub1 and Sub2 to agree to a transfer price of $16.", "Definition of Death Spiral": "In cost accounting and managerial accounting, the term death spiral refers to the repeated elimination of a manufacturer\u2019s products which will result in spreading the fixed manufacturing overhead costs to fewer products. In addition, the low volume cannot support its administrative expenses. The death spiral is also known as the downward demand spiral.", "Example of Death Spiral": "Assume that a company manufactures a wide variety of products that require multiple, complicated processes involving expensive equipment. It also manufacturers Products X & Y, which are much higher volume products using a simple process involving inexpensive machines. If the company allocates its fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products based on volume (such as production machine hours), Products X & Y will  appear to have high overhead costs. (In reality, Products X & Y cause very little overhead cost in relation to the main, complicated, lower volume products.) If management responds to the high allocated overhead costs for Products X & Y by seeking price increases from its customers, the customers may move the production to a competitor who realizes there is little overhead costs involved in the products. With the Products X & Y no longer being manufactured, the company\u2019s manufacturing production machine hours will decrease significantly. If the company does not reduce its fixed manufacturing overhead and the accountant continues to spread the overhead costs\u2014including the cost of excess capacity\u2014on the basis of volume, the remaining products will have to be assigned more of the overhead costs. If management again reacts to the new, higher, allocated costs by seeking price increases and loses sales, the company\u2019s manufacturing volume will decrease further. If fixed costs are not decreased accordingly and the accountant again spreads the overhead on the basis of fewer production machine hours, the entire company could die from the high fixed costs and a small volume of products that cannot support the manufacturing and administrative costs. To avoid the death spiral, some companies attempt to allocate overhead costs based on activities and product complexities rather than simply spreading them on production machine hours. Also, some companies do not allocate the costs of excess capacity to products in order to minimize the death spiral.", "Definition of Zero-Based Budgeting": "Zero-based budgeting, or ZBB, is a rigorous budgeting process that requires that every dollar of every expense in the budget be justified, even if the expense has been occurring at the same level for years. In other words, instead of the common budgeting practice of accepting the past level of an expense and adjusting that amount for the new budget, ZBB starts with $0 and requires that every dollar must be justified to be included in the new budget.", "Example of Zero-Based Budgeting": "Assume that a company has been spending $100,000 a year for the rent of a warehouse. In the past budgets the company accepted the $100,000 of rent and focused on the amount of the increase for the next budget. This year the chief executive of the company insists that the company begin using zero-based budgeting. This means that the starting amount for warehouse rent (and every other expense) for the next budget is $0. Any budgeted expense greater than $0 must be justified. While zero-based budgeting will be more time consuming than focusing on incremental changes, ZBB can result in significant cost savings. For instance, the analysis and documentation of the warehousing activities required by zero-based budgeting may lead to a better use of space, better inventory management, etc. If those efficiencies are achievable, perhaps the budget for the warehouse rent should be $60,000 (instead of $103,000 or more). Zero-based budgeting was widely discussed in the 1970s for businesses and governments. Today, it is again being discussed since a few large corporations have used the ZBB process to significantly reduce unnecessary expenses.", "Definition of Correlation": "Correlation refers to the association between two or more variables. The association is measured by a statistic known as the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient), which has a range of -1 to +1 (\u201c0\u201d indicates no correlation and \u201c1\u201d indicates perfect correlation). Measuring the correlation between variables can be helpful, but a high degree of correlation does not guarantee that a change in one variable was actually caused by the other variable. (Often early medical research indicates the discovery of association between X and Y, but additional studies must be done before they can conclude there is cause and effect.) To recap, correlation does not assure that there is a cause and effect relationship. However, if there is a cause and effect relationship, there has to be correlation. ", "Example of Correlation": "Assume that during a 10-year period the number of cars sold in the U.S. moved in the same direction as the country\u2019s rate of inflation. Even with a 10-year correlation between the two sets of data, it is unlikely that more inflation caused an increase in the number of cars sold.  Accountants can find the level of correlation between variables by using statistical software. For example,  simple linear regression analysis (and multiple regression analysis) software can be used to determine the relationship of production machine hours and mixed costs.", "Definition of Sunk Cost": "A sunk cost is a cost that was incurred in the past and cannot be undone. Since most transactions cannot be undone, most amounts spent in the past are sunk. A past or sunk cost will be there regardless of what is decided today or in the future. Expressed another way, since we cannot undo the past, every decision will affect only today and/or the future. As a result, the relevant costs and benefits for making a decision are the current and future costs. Unfortunately, we do not find the future costs in a company\u2019s general ledger. At best, those past/sunk costs may help us determine the relevant current and future costs and potential income tax benefits.", "Example of a Sunk Cost": "Assume that a year ago a company spent $100,000 to purchase and install a new machine. Today, a robot became available for $80,000 and it is expected to reduce expenses by $50,000 in each of the next 10 years. Today, the one-year-old machine can be sold for just $10,000. In the decision whether to purchase the robot, the $100,000 spent on the one-year-old machine is a sunk cost.  Ignoring any income tax consequences, what is relevant for the decision on purchasing the robot is whether to spend an additional $70,000 today (the $80,000 cost of the robot minus the $10,000 to be received from the old machine) in order to save $50,000 each year for 10 years. It may be difficult to accept that $100,000 was spent a year ago, but spending an additional $70,000 today to earn (reduce expenses) $50,000 each year for 10 year is really a simple decision.", "Definition of Capital Budgeting": "Capital budgeting is a process used by companies for evaluating and ranking potential capital expenditures or investments that are significant in amount.

The flexible budget is more sophisticated and useful than a static budget. (The static budget amounts do not change. They remain unchanged from the amounts established at the time that the static budget was prepared and approved.) For costs that vary with volume or activity, the flexible budget will flex because the budget will include a variable rate per unit of activity instead of one fixed total amount.

It also knows that other costs are fixed costs of  approximately $40,000 per month. Typically, the machine hours are between 4,000 and 7,000 hours per month. Based on this information, the flexible budget for each month would be $40,000 + $10 per MH. Now let\u2019s illustrate the flexible budget by using different levels of volume. If 5,000 machine hours were necessary for the month of January, the flexible budget for January will be $90,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 5,000 MH).

Allocating the many different (and ever increasing amounts of) indirect manufacturing costs on the basis of a single factor (such as machine hours) is likely to lead to misleading costs for a manufacturer\u2019s goods. To address this deficiency, the activity based costing (ABC) method attempts to identify all of the diverse activities that occur and assign the costs of those activities only to the products that require the activities.", "Example of Traditional Method of Cost Accounting": "Assume that a manufacturer has $2,000,000 of manufacturing overhead costs consisting of depreciation, electricity, insurance, compensation of supervisors, production engineers, material handlers, equipment maintenance, etc. The manufacturer has 40,000 production machine hours. Using the traditional method of cost accounting, the company will allocate or assign $50 of overhead of each machine used to produce the output. Applying $50 per machine hour for every product will spread the overhead costs, but will not recognize the variety of activities and efforts that occur with different products.  The traditional method may have been reasonable or at least sufficient for the company\u2019s external financial statements (especially when similar products are manufactured and inventory levels are consistently small). However, the traditional method will be inadequate for determining the true cost for diverse goods being produced and sold to customers with diverse demands.", "Definition of Indirect Manufacturing Costs": "Indirect manufacturing costs are a manufacturer\u2019s production costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, factory burden, or burden. US GAAP requires that indirect manufacturing costs be allocated to, assigned to, or absorbed by the manufacturer\u2019s output (in addition to the cost of direct materials and direct labor) for its  external financial statements. This is known as absorption costing and must be used in determining a manufacturer\u2019s cost of goods sold and the cost of its inventory. In traditional cost accounting, the indirect manufacturing costs are allocated to the products manufactured based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or production machine hours. However, in recent decades the indirect manufacturing costs have increased significantly and are less likely to be caused by the quantity of direct labor or production machine hours. (This may not be a problem for financial reporting when the amount of inventory is consistently small, but it can be a problem for pricing and other decisions.)", "Examples of Indirect Manufacturing Costs": "Some examples of indirect manufacturing costs include:", "Definition of Relevant Range": "In accounting, the term relevant range usually refers to a normal range of volume or normal amount of activity in which the total amount of a company\u2019s fixed costs will not change as the volume or amount of activity changes. The term relevant range is included in the definition of fixed costs, because if a company\u2019s volume were to decline to an extremely low level, the company would take action to decrease its total amount of fixed costs. Similarly, if the company\u2019s volume were to increase dramatically, the company would likely have to increase the total amount of its fixed costs.  ", "Example of Relevant Range": "Let\u2019s assume that a manufacturer\u2019s monthly production volume is consistently between 10,000 to 13,000 units of product requiring between 20,000 to 25,000 machine hours. Within these ranges of activity, the manufacturing operations run smoothly with the same amount of monthly fixed costs, which on average are approximately $200,000 per month for the cost of supervisors, rent, depreciation, and other fixed costs. However, if the manufacturer\u2019s volume were to drop to say 7,000 units of product and/or to 14,000 machine hours, it would likely reduce the number of its supervisors, the space it rents, and some other fixed costs in order to reduce the $200,000 of monthly fixed costs. If the company\u2019s volume were to increase to 18,000 units of product and/or 30,000 machine hours, the company would likely have to increase its total fixed costs to pay for additional supervisors, space, and other fixed costs. Hence, an experienced accountant would say that the company\u2019s fixed costs are approximately $200,000 per month within a relevant range of activity.", "Definition of Plant-wide Overhead Rate": "A plant-wide overhead rate is often a single rate per hour or a percentage of some cost that is used to allocate or assign a company\u2019s manufacturing overhead costs to the goods produced. A plant-wide rate could be adequate in the following situations:", "Example of Plant-wide Overhead Rate": "Let\u2019s assume that a company\u2019s manufacturing overhead costs (equipment depreciation, electricity, maintenance, supervisors, etc.) is budgeted to be $800,000 for the new year. The company produces similar products and it expects to use 20,000 machine hours. Based on this information, the company\u2019s plant-wide overhead rate will be $40 per machine hour. If each product requires 15 minutes of machine time, each product\u2019s cost will include $10 of manufacturing overhead (15 minutes = 1/4 hour X $40 per machine hour).", "Definition of a Budget": "In business and other organizations, a budget often refers to a department\u2019s or a company\u2019s projected revenues, costs, or expenses.", "Definition of a Standard": "In accounting, a standard is likely to mean an expected amount per unit of product, per unit of input (such as direct materials, factory overhead), or per unit of output.", "Examples of a Budget and a Standard": "Typically, a manufacturer will have a budget for each of its manufacturing departments. Assume that the finishing department\u2019s budget for the upcoming year is $400,000 and is expected to process 50,000 identical units of product.  Some companies will develop standard costs for controlling its operations. For example, the standard cost of processing all identical units in the finishing department is $8 (based on its budget of $400,000 divided by the expected 50,000 identical units). Therefore, if 4,000 units are processed, the standard cost of the company\u2019s inventory will be increased by $32,000. If the products processed by the finishing department are not identical (some require 0.6 a machine hour, some 1.0 machine hour, some 1.2 machine hours) the finishing department\u2019s $400,000 budget could be divided by the total expected number of machine hours. Assume that total number of expected machine hours is 40,000 to finish the 50,000 units of product. Therefore, the standard cost for each expected machine hour will be $10 ($400,000 budget divided by the expected 40,000 machine hours). If the finishing of 4,000 units should have taken 3,500 standard machine hours, the standard cost of the units processed in the finishing department will be $35,000 (3,500 standard machine hours X $10 standard cost per machine hour).", "Definition of Setup Cost": "In manufacturing, setup cost is the cost incurred to get equipment ready to process a different batch of goods. Hence, setup cost is regarded as a batch-level cost in activity based costing. Setup cost is considered to be a non-value-added cost that should be minimized.", "Examples of Setup Costs": "Setup costs include the following:", "Definition of Actual Costing": "For a manufacturer, actual costing means assigning the following costs to the actual goods produced each month:", "Examples of Normal Costing and Actual Costing": "Assume that a manufacturer experiences an additional $200,000 in manufacturing overhead costs (air conditioning and other) in each of the months of June, July, and August. The overhead costs in each of the other 9 months is $1,000,000. Therefore, on an annual basis the manufacturing overhead is $12,600,000. Assume that the overhead costs are assigned/allocated/applied to products using machine hours (MHs). MHs are 50,000 each month, except for December and January when each month has 30,000 MHs. Therefore, for the year there are expected to be 560,000 MHs. Using normal costing, the company applies the manufacturing overhead to products at a rate of $22.50 per MH ($12,600,000/560,000 MH) throughout the year. Using actual costing, the company will apply the manufacturing overhead to products at the following rates:", "Definition of Fixed Overhead Absorbed": "Fixed overhead absorbed refers to a manufacturer\u2019s fixed indirect manufacturing/production costs. Since these costs are indirect, they must be assigned or allocated to the products manufactured. This is required because U.S. accounting principles and income tax regulations require manufacturers to follow full absorption costing. This means that the cost of manufactured goods must include the costs of the direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and fixed manufacturing overhead. Accountants will state that the goods produced must absorb the fixed manufacturing overhead costs. It is common that the fixed manufacturing overhead costs are absorbed by the goods produced (or are assigned/allocated to the goods produced) through predetermined overhead rates based on the number of machine hours.", "Example of Fixed Overhead Absorbed": "Assume that TOPCO has budgeted next year\u2019s fixed manufacturing overhead costs to be $2,000,000 (consisting of depreciation on its equipment, salaries of the managers involved in the manufacturing operations, utilities, etc.). TOPCO also anticipates there will be 100,000 machine hours (MHs) involved in the production of goods. Therefore, the company will be assigning to the goods produced (and the goods will be absorbing) the fixed manufacturing overhead costs at the rate of $20 per MH.  If the actual production volume is less than the planned volume (and the costs are as planned) the fixed manufacturing overhead will be underabsorbed. When the actual volume exceeds the planned volume (and the costs are as planned) the fixed manufacturing overhead will be overabsorbed.", "Definition of Traditional Method Allocating Factory Overhead": "The traditional method of allocating factory overhead (manufacturing overhead, burden) means spreading the manufacturing overhead costs to the goods produced on the basis of the number of the production machine hours used or the number of direct labor hours used.", "Weakness of Traditional Method of Allocating Factory Overhead": "The weakness of the traditional method is that all of the factory overhead is being assigned to the goods produced by just one factor such as the production machine hours. In reality there are many factors that are driving up the factory overhead costs. Here are a few examples of some of the activities (in addition to the production machine hours) that cause the factory overhead costs to increase:", "Definition of Service Department": "A service department is usually associated with a manufacturer\u2019s production departments. However, a service department does not produce any of the factory\u2019s output. Instead, it provides services to the production departments. Each service department is responsible for its costs. Hence, the service departments are separate cost centers. The costs incurred by the service departments are considered to be indirect manufacturing costs that ultimately must get allocated to the goods produced.", "Examples of Service Departments": "Common examples of service departments include:", "Definition of Departmental Overhead Rates": "Departmental overhead rates are used by many manufacturers to allocate (assign, apply) manufacturing overhead to the goods it produces instead of using a single, plant-wide overhead rate. The reason for departmental overhead rates is that manufacturers are likely to produce many diverse products which use different processes in different departments and each has different costs.", "Example of Departmental Overhead Rates": "Assume that a manufacturer has three processes or operations that occur in separate departments:", "Definition of Overabsorbed and Underabsorbed": "In cost accounting, overabsorbed and underabsorbed pertain to a manufacturer\u2019s manufacturing overhead costs. The manufacturing overhead costs are the indirect product and production costs. (These are in addition to the other product and production costs of direct materials and direct labor.)  Since the fixed manufacturing overhead costs (such as depreciation, salaries of manufacturing personnel, etc.) are indirect costs that occur in large amounts, they must be assigned or allocated to the products manufactured. This is often done by using a predetermined overhead rate. The predetermined rate is likely based on the amount from the annual manufacturing overhead budget divided by some activity such as the expected number of machine hours. The assigning of fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs are part of the cost accounting method known as absorption costing, which is required by U.S. GAAP and U.S. income tax regulations. Absorption costing means that fixed manufacturing costs must be assigned to the products manufactured. In other words, the products must absorb the fixed manufacturing overhead. If the amount of overhead assigned to the products manufactured is greater than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have overabsorbed the overhead costs. If the amount of overhead assigned to the products is less than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have underabsorbed the overhead costs.", "Example of Overabsorbed and Underabsorbed Overhead Costs": "Assume a manufacturer has an annual budget of $1,000,000 for its fixed manufacturing overhead and expects its production machines to run 40,000 hours.

Manufacturing overhead is allocated to products for various reasons including compliance with U.S. accounting principles and income tax regulations. Traditionally, the predetermined manufacturing overhead rate was calculated prior to a new year by dividing the budgeted amount of manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year by the normal or expected number of production machine hours for the upcoming year. Using the planned annual amounts for the upcoming year reduces the  fluctuations that would occur if monthly rates were used. A manufacturer producing a variety of products that require different processes will have multiple overhead rates known as departmental overhead rates instead of just one plant-wide overhead rate.", "Example of Predetermined Overhead Rate": "Prior to the start of the accounting year, JKL Corp calculates the predetermined annual overhead rate to be used in the new year. JKL\u2019s profit plan for the new year includes $1,200,000 as the budgeted amount of manufacturing overhead. JKL allocates the manufacturing overhead based on the normal and expected number of production machine hours which are 20,000 for the new year.

When an actual cost is less than the budgeted amount, the cost variance is said to be favorable.", "Cost Variances in Standard Costing Systems": "Cost variances are a key part of the standard costing system used by some manufacturers. In such a system, the cost variances direct attention to the difference between 1) the standard, predetermined and expected costs of the good output, and 2) the actual manufacturing costs incurred.

Standard costing systems report a minimum of two cost variances for each of the following manufacturing costs:", "Definition of Purchase Price Variance": "In standard costing, the purchase price variance is the difference between the actual cost per pound (or other unit of measure) for the raw materials the company purchased and the company\u2019s standard cost per pound for the raw materials that were purchased. (The standard cost per pound is the cost that the company expected to pay for the year and was included in the company\u2019s profit plan.) Any price variances for the materials purchased are recorded in the company\u2019s general ledger account Materials Purchase Price Variance.  The company\u2019s general ledger accounts for inventories (raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods) and the cost of goods sold will contain the standard cost per pound for the raw materials.", "Example of Reclassifying the Purchase Price Variance": "Before a company\u2019s financial statements are issued, the balance in the Materials Purchase Price Variance account must be reclassified or allocated to the following: raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold. The allocation should be based on the location of the raw materials which created the purchase price variance. If those raw materials were recently purchased and are entirely in the raw materials inventory, then all of the price variance should be assigned to the raw materials inventory. If the price variance occurred throughout the year, the variance should be assigned to the raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold based on the quantity of the raw materials in each of these categories at the end of the year.

You prepared the department\u2019s annual budget based on the company\u2019s assumption that 50,000 items will be shipped during the budget year. If the annual budget is not changed when more or less than 50,000 items are shipped, it is referred to as a static budget. A summary of the department\u2019s static budget based on shipping 50,000 items is:\nFixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $150,000 (50,000 items X $3 each) = total static budget of $500,000. Unlike the static budget, a flexible budget for the shipping department will increase when more than 50,000 items for the year are shipped and it will decrease when fewer than 50,000 items are shipped. Let\u2019s assume that for the year, the department actually shipped 54,000 items. Therefore, the flexible budget for the variable expenses will \u201cflex\u201d for shipping the additional 4,000 items. The resulting flexible budget summary is:\nFixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $162,000 (54,000 items X $3 each) = total flexible budget of $512,000.", "Flexible Budget Variance": "Now let\u2019s assume that the shipping department\u2019s actual expenses for the year were:\nFixed expenses of $351,000 + variable expenses of $157,000 = total actual expenses of $508,000. The department\u2019s total flexible budget variance is $4,000 favorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were less than the flexible budget of $512,000. Note that the shipping department\u2019s total static budget variance is $8,000 unfavorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were more than the static budget of $500,000.

Based on this, the manufacturer established a predetermined fixed manufacturing overhead rate of $10 per standard machine hour. If the company actually produces 29,000 standard machine hours of good output, the output (products) will be assigned (or will have absorbed) $290,000 of the fixed manufacturing overhead. This will cause an unfavorable production volume variance of $10,000 ($300,000 budgeted vs. $290,000 assigned; or 1,000 too few standard machine hours of good output X $10 per standard machine hour). If our example had stated that the manufacturer actually produced 32,000 standard machine hours of good output, the products would have been assigned $320,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead costs compared to the budgeted amount of $300,000.

If these materials have some negative qualities, it may lead to an unfavorable materials usage variance. If the materials\u2019 negative qualities cause additional direct labor hours, an unfavorable direct labor efficiency variance will result. If the materials required using more experienced labor, it is possible that a labor rate variance will also occur. The above situation can also extend to the overhead variances. If more electricity and supplies had to be used because of the lesser quality of materials, this can also mean an unfavorable variable overhead efficiency variance. If the volume of output is curtailed by the quality of the materials, there could possibly be a fixed overhead volume variance. Companies should have specifications for its materials in order to prevent the above situation from occurring.", "When is a Variance Unfavorable": "The term unfavorable variance indicates that the variance (or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts) was not good for the company\u2019s profits.
