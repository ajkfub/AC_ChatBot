The issue related to an employee benefit trust (or similar entity) that has been set up by a sponsoring entity specifically to facilitate the transfer of its equity instruments to its employees under a share‑based payment arrangement. The trust holds shares of the sponsoring entity that are acquired by the trust from the sponsoring entity or from the market. Acquisition of those shares is funded either by the sponsoring entity or by a bank loan, usually guaranteed by the sponsoring entity. In most circumstances, the sponsoring entity controls the employee benefit trust. In some circumstances, the sponsoring entity may also have a direct control of the shares held by the trust. The issue is whether guidance should be developed on the accounting treatment for the sponsor’s equity instruments held by the employee benefit trust in the sponsor’s separate financial statements. The IFRIC discussed whether the employee benefit trust should be treated as an extension of the sponsoring entity, such as a branch, or as a separate entity. The IFRIC noted that the notion of ‘entity’ is defined neither in the Framework nor in IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The IFRIC then discussed whether the sponsoring entity should, in its separate financial statements, account for the net investment according to IAS 27 or rather for the rights and obligations arising from the assets and liabilities of the trust. The IFRIC noted that, in some circumstances, the sponsoring entity may have direct control of the shares held by the trust. The IFRIC also noted that the guidance included in the Framework and IAS 27 does not address the accounting for the shares held by the trust in the sponsor’s separate financial statements. The IFRIC concluded that it could not reach a consensus on this matter on a timely basis, given the different types of trusts and trust arrangements that exist. The IFRIC noted that this issue related to two active projects of the IASB: the Conceptual Framework and the revision of IAS 27 in the course of the Consolidation project. For these reasons, the IFRIC decided not to add the issue to its agenda. (Since this agenda decision, IAS 27 has been amended and SIC‑12 was incorporated into IFRS 10.)]",

By granting shares or share options, in addition to other remuneration, the entity is paying additional remuneration to obtain additional benefits.

In these rare cases only, the entity shall instead: (a) measure the equity instruments at their intrinsic value, initially at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service and subsequently at the end of each reporting period and at the date of final settlement, with any change in intrinsic value recognised in profit or loss. For a grant of share options, the share‑based payment arrangement is finally settled when the options are exercised, are forfeited (eg upon cessation of employment) or lapse (eg at the end of the option’s life).

At the date the transactions were entered into, the parties involved understood the terms and conditions of the plans including the formula that would be used to determine the amount of cash to be paid to each individual employee (or the number of shares to be delivered to each individual employee) but the exact amount of cash or number of shares would be known only at a future date. The IFRIC was asked to confirm the grant date and vesting period for such share plans. The IFRIC noted that IFRS 2 defines grant date as the date when there is a shared understanding of the terms and conditions. Moreover, IFRS 2 does not require grant date to be the date when the exact amount of cash to be paid (or the exact number of shares to be delivered) is known to the parties involved. The IFRIC further noted that share‑based payment transactions with cash alternatives at the discretion of the counterparty are addressed in paragraphs 34–40 of IFRS 2. Paragraph 35 of IFRS 2 states that, if an entity has granted the counterparty the right to choose whether a share‑based payment transaction is settled in cash or by issuing equity instruments, the entity has granted a compound financial instrument, which includes a debt component (ie the counterparty’s right to demand cash payment) and an equity component (ie the counterparty’s right to demand settlement in equity instruments). Paragraph 38 of IFRS 2 states that the entity shall account separately for goods or services received or acquired in respect of each component of the compound financial instrument. The IFRIC therefore believed that the vesting period of the equity component and that of the debt component should be determined separately and the vesting period of each component might be different. The IFRIC believed that, since ‘grant date’ is defined in IFRS 2 and the requirements set out in paragraphs 34–40 of IFRS 2 were clear, the issues were not expected to create significant divergence in practice. The IFRIC therefore decided that the issues should not be added to the agenda.]",

For transactions with parties other than employees, in which the fair value of the goods or services received is measured directly, the entity shall measure the equity component of the compound financial instrument as the difference between the fair value of the goods or services received and the fair value of the debt component, at the date when the goods or services are received.",

[Refer:Implementation Guidance paragraphs IG20–IG22 and IG example 13] The fair value of the compound financial instrument is the sum of the fair values of the two components. However, share‑based payment transactions in which the counterparty has the choice of settlement are often structured so that the fair value of one settlement alternative is the same as the other. For example, the counterparty might have the choice of receiving share options or cash‑settled share appreciation rights. In such cases, the fair value of the equity component is zero, and hence the fair value of the compound financial instrument is the same as the fair value of the debt component. Conversely, if the fair values of the settlement alternatives differ, the fair value of the equity component usually will be greater than zero, in which case the fair value of the compound financial instrument will be greater than the fair value of the debt component.",

The IFRIC noted that IFRS 2 defines a share‑based payment transaction as a transaction in which the entity receives goods or services as consideration for equity instruments of the entity or amounts that are based on the price of equity instruments of the entity. The IFRIC further noted that the definition of a share‑based payment transaction does not require the exposure of the entity to be linked to movements in the share price of the entity. Moreover, it is clear that IFRS 2 contemplates share‑based payment transactions in which the terms of the arrangement provide the entity with a choice of settlement, since they are specifically addressed in paragraphs 41–43 of IFRS 2. The IFRIC therefore believed that, although the amount of the settlement did not vary with changes in the share price of the entity, such share plans are share‑based payment transactions in accordance with IFRS 2 since the consideration may be equity instruments of the entity. The IFRIC also believed that, even in the extreme circumstances in which the entity was given a choice of settlement and the value of the shares that would be delivered was a fixed monetary amount, those share plans were still within the scope of IFRS 2.

The Board discussed these issues at its meeting in September 2006 and the Board’s observations were communicated to the IFRIC at its meeting in November 2006. The IFRIC decided not to add the issue to the agenda. A tentative decision was published in the November 2006 IFRIC Update. At its meeting in January 2007, the IFRIC decided to add a limited scope project on derecognition to its agenda. However, the project has been inactive pending the availability of staff resources. Subsequently, the Board has accelerated its project to develop a replacement for the sections of IAS 39 that would have been interpreted by this IFRIC issue. The Board expects to issue a new standard on this topic no later than 2010. Therefore the IFRIC decided to remove this issue from its agenda.

(a) Paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to a part of a financial asset (or a part of a group of similar financial assets) if, and only if, the part being considered for derecognition meets one of the following three conditions. (i) The part comprises only specifically identified cash flows from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets). For example, when an entity enters into an interest rate strip whereby the counterparty obtains the right to the interest cash flows, but not the principal cash flows from a debt instrument, paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to the interest cash flows. (ii) The part comprises only a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of the cash flows from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets). For example, when an entity enters into an arrangement whereby the counterparty obtains the rights to a 90 per cent share of all cash flows of a debt instrument, paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to 90 per cent of those cash flows. If there is more than one counterparty, each counterparty is not required to have a proportionate share of the cash flows provided that the transferring entity has a fully proportionate share. (iii) The part comprises only a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of specifically identified cash flows from a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets). For example, when an entity enters into an arrangement whereby the counterparty obtains the rights to a 90 per cent share of interest cash flows from a financial asset, paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to 90 per cent of those interest cash flows. If there is more than one counterparty, each counterparty is not required to have a proportionate share of the specifically identified cash flows provided that the transferring entity has a fully proportionate share. [Refer:paragraphs B3.2.10 and B3.2.11] (b) In all other cases, paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to the financial asset in its entirety (or to the group of similar financial assets in their entirety). For example, when an entity transfers (i) the rights to the first or the last 90 per cent of cash collections from a financial asset (or a group of financial assets), or (ii) the rights to 90 per cent of the cash flows from a group of receivables, but provides a guarantee to compensate the buyer for any credit losses up to 8 per cent of the principal amount of the receivables, paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.9 are applied to the financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets) in its entirety. In paragraphs 3.2.3–3.2.12, the term ‘financial asset’ refers to either a part of a financial asset (or a part of a group of similar financial assets) as identified in (a) above or, otherwise, a financial asset (or a group of similar financial assets) in its entirety.

The financial instrument has a stated maturity date and, at maturity, the issuer must deliver a variable number of its own equity instruments to equal a fixed cash amount—subject to a cap and a floor, which limit and guarantee, respectively, the number of equity instruments to be delivered. The Interpretations Committee noted that the issuer’s obligation to deliver a variable number of the entity’s own equity instruments is a non-derivative that meets the definition of a financial liability in paragraph 11(b)(i) of IAS 32 in its entirety. Paragraph 11(b)(i) of the definition of a liability does not have any limits or thresholds regarding the degree of variability that is required. Therefore, the contractual substance of the instrument is a single obligation to deliver a variable number of equity instruments at maturity, with the variation based on the value of those equity instruments. Such a single obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments cannot be subdivided into components for the purposes of evaluating whether the instrument contains a component that meets the definition of equity. Even though the number of equity instruments to be delivered is limited and guaranteed by the cap and the floor, the overall number of equity instruments that the issuer is obliged to deliver is not fixed and therefore the entire obligation meets the definition of a financial liability. Furthermore, the Interpretations Committee noted that the cap and the floor are embedded derivative features whose values change in response to the price of the issuer’s equity share. Therefore, assuming that the issuer has not elected to designate the entire instrument under the fair value option, the issuer must separate those features and account for the embedded derivative features separately from the host liability contract at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39 or IFRS 9.

(b) The customer has legal title to the asset—legal title may indicate which party to a contract has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, an asset or to restrict the access of other entities to those benefits.

In addition to disclosure objectives, the key principles are that an entity: (a) identifies its insurance contracts. (b) separates specified embedded derivatives, distinct investment components and distinct performance obligations from the insurance contracts. (c) divides the contracts into groups it will recognise and measure at: (i) a risk-adjusted present value of the future cash flows; plus (if this value is a liability) or minus (if this value is an asset) (ii) an amount representing the unearned profit in the group of contracts (the contractual service margin). (d) recognises the profit from a group of insurance contracts over the period the entity provides insurance coverage, and as the entity is released from risk. If a group of contracts is or becomes loss-making, an entity recognises the loss immediately. (e) presents separately insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and insurance finance income or expenses. Some insurance contracts provide investment-return or investment related-service in addition to insurance coverage. In June 2020, the Board amended IFRS 17 to require an entity to recognise the profit from a group of insurance contracts over the period the entity provides insurance contract services (Refer: Basis for Conclusions paragraphs BC283A–BC283J).]",

Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an entity’s customary business practices. Contractual terms include all terms in a contract, explicit or implied, but an entity shall disregard terms that have no commercial substance (ie no discernible effect on the economics of the contract). Implied terms in a contract include those imposed by law or regulation. The practices and processes for establishing contracts with customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities.
