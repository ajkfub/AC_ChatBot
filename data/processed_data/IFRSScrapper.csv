what is the IFRS for fair value measurements?,"""This IFRS applies when another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurements or disclosures about fair value measurements (and measurements, such as fair value less costs to sell, based on fair value or disclosures about those measurements), except as specified in paragraphs 6 and 7."

What is the fair value measurement framework?,The fair value measurement framework described in this IFRS applies to both initial and subsequent measurement if fair value is required or permitted by other IFRSs.
what is fair value?,This IFRS defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction [Refer:paragraphs B43 and B44] between market participants at the measurement date.
what is the fair value measurement approach?,Paragraph B2 describes the overall fair value measurement approach.
What are the characteristics of an asset or liability?,"Such characteristics include, for example, the following: (a) the condition and location of the asset; and (b) restrictions, if any, on the sale or use of the asset."
what is the effect of a particular characteristic on the measurement?,The effect on the measurement arising from a particular characteristic will differ depending on how that characteristic would be taken into account by market participants.
what is the definition of a fair value?,"""The asset or liability measured at fair value might be either of the following: (a) a standalone asset or liability (eg a financial instrument or a nonfinancial asset); or (b) a group of assets, a group of liabilities or a group of assets and liabilities (eg a cashgenerating unit or a business)."
What is the unit of account for the asset or liability?,"""Whether the asset or liability is a standalone asset or liability, a group of assets, a group of liabilities or a group of assets and liabilities for recognition or disclosure purposes depends on its unit of account [Refer:Appendix A]."
What is the definition of a fair value measurement?,"""A fair value measurement assumes that the asset or liability is exchanged in an orderly transaction [Refer:paragraphs 2, 9, 24, B43 and B44] between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date under current market conditions."
Where does the fair value measurement take place?,"""A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: [Refer:Illustrative Examples, example 6] (a) in the principal market for the asset or liability; or (b) in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability."
What is the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market?,"In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the market in which the entity would normally enter into a transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability is presumed to be the principal market or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market."
what is the fair value of the asset or liability?,"""If there is a principal market for the asset or liability, the fair value measurement shall represent the price in that market (whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique) [Refer:paragraphs 61 and 62], even if the price in a different market is potentially more advantageous at the measurement date."
What is the principal market for the same asset or liability?,"Because different entities (and businesses within those entities) with different activities may have access to different markets, the principal (or most advantageous) market for the same asset or liability might be different for different entities (and businesses within those entities)."
Does the entity need to be able to sell the particular asset or transfer the particular liability on?,"""Although an entity must be able to access the market, the entity does not need to be able to sell the particular asset or transfer the particular liability on the measurement date to be able to measure fair value on the basis of the price in that market."
What is the basis for estimating the price to sell the asset or to transfer the liability?,[Refer:paragraph 62] That assumed transaction establishes a basis for estimating the price to sell the asset or to transfer the liability.
what is the fair value of an asset?,"""An entity shall measure the fair value of an asset or a liability using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest."
What is the purpose of the paragraph?,"""In developing those assumptions, an entity need not identify specific market participants."
what is the value of an asset?,Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (ie an exit price) regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique [Refer:paragraphs 61 and 62].
What is the difference between a transaction cost and a characteristic of an asset?,"Transaction costs are not a characteristic of an asset or a liability; rather, they are specific to a transaction and will differ depending on how an entity enters into a transaction for the asset or liability."
what is a characteristic of the asset?,"If location is a characteristic of the asset (as might be the case, for example, for a commodity), the price in the principal (or most advantageous) market shall be adjusted for the costs, if any, that would be incurred to transport the asset from its current location to that market."
what is a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset?,A fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
What is the definition of a use that is legally permissible?,"(b) A use that is legally permissible takes into account any legal restrictions on the use of the asset [Refer:Illustrative Examples, example 9] that market participants [Refer:paragraphs 22 and 23] would take into account when pricing the asset (eg the zoning regulations applicable to a property)."
What is the best use of a nonfinancial asset?,"However, an entity’s current use of a nonfinancial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset."
What is the purpose of the paragraph?,"""To protect its competitive position, or for other reasons, an entity may intend not to use an acquired nonfinancial asset actively or it may intend not to use the asset according to its highest and best use [Refer:Basis for Conclusions paragraph BC70]."
What is the best use of a nonfinancial asset?,"""The highest and best use [Refer:paragraphs 27–30] of a nonfinancial asset establishes the valuation premise used to measure the fair value of the asset, as follows: (a) The highest and best use of a nonfinancial asset might provide maximum value to market participants [Refer:paragraphs 22 and 23] through its use in combination with other assets as a group (as installed or otherwise configured for use) or in combination with other assets and liabilities (eg a business)."
What is the case even when a fair value measurement assumes that the highest and best use?,[Refer:paragraph 14] That is the case even when that fair value measurement assumes that the highest and best use of the asset is to use it in combination with other assets or with other assets and liabilities because a fair value measurement assumes that the market participant already holds the complementary assets and the associated liabilities.
what is the valuation premise concept for nonfinancial assets?,Paragraph B3 describes the application of the valuation premise concept for nonfinancial assets.
What is the definition of a fair value measurement?,A fair value measurement assumes that a financial or nonfinancial liability or an entity’s own equity instrument (eg equity interests issued as consideration in a business combination) is transferred to a market participant [Refer:paragraphs 22 and 23] at the measurement date.
what is the basis for conclusion?,"""Even when there is no observable market to provide pricing information about the transfer of a liability or an entity’s own equity instrument (eg because contractual or other legal restrictions prevent the transfer of such items [Refer:paragraphs 45 and 46 and Basis for Conclusions paragraphs BC99 and BC100]), there might be an observable market for such items if they are held by other parties as assets (eg a corporate bond or a call option on an entity’s shares)."
What is the objective of a fair value measurement?,"""In all cases, an entity shall maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs to meet the objective of a fair value measurement, which is to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to transfer the liability or equity instrument would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions."
what is the fair value of the liability or equity instrument?,"""When a quoted price for the transfer of an identical or a similar liability or entity’s own equity instrument is not available and the identical item is held by another party as an asset, an entity shall measure the fair value of the liability or equity instrument from the perspective of a market participant that holds the identical item as an asset at the measurement date."
what is the best way to measure the fair value of a liability or equity instrument?,"[Refer:paragraph 81] (c) if the observable prices in (a) and (b) are not available, using another valuation technique, such as: (i) an income approach [Refer:paragraph B10] (eg a present value technique [Refer:Illustrative Examples, examples 10, 11 and 13] that takes into account the future cash flows that a market participant would expect to receive from holding the liability or equity instrument as an asset; see paragraphs B10 and B11)."
What is the objective of the paragraph?,"[Refer:paragraph 44] If the unit of account for the liability is not for the combined package, the objective is to measure the fair value of the issuer’s liability, not the fair value of the combined package."
what is the basis for conclusion?,"""When a quoted price for the transfer of an identical or a similar liability or entity’s own equity instrument is not available and the identical item is not held by another party as an asset, an entity shall measure the fair value of the liability or equity instrument using a valuation technique from the perspective of a market participant [Refer:paragraphs 22 and 23] that owes the liability or has issued the claim on equity [Refer:Basis for Conclusions paragraph BC90]."
what would be the amount that a market participant would receive to enter into or issue an identical?,"(b) the amount that a market participant would receive to enter into or issue an identical liability or equity instrument, using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the identical item (eg having the same credit characteristics) in the principal (or most advantageous) market [Refer:paragraph 16] for issuing a liability or an equity instrument with the same contractual terms."
What does the definition of nonperformance risk mean?,"Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited to, an entity’s own credit risk (as defined in IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures)."
what is the effect of credit risk on the liability?,"""When measuring the fair value of a liability, an entity shall take into account the effect of its credit risk (credit standing) and any other factors that might influence the likelihood that the obligation will or will not be fulfilled."
What is the difference between the credit enhancement and the liability?,"If the credit enhancement is accounted for separately from the liability, the issuer would take into account its own credit standing and not that of the third party guarantor when measuring the fair value of the liability."
What is the effect of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability or an?,The effect of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability or an entity’s own equity instrument is either implicitly or explicitly included in the other inputs to the fair value measurement.
What is the difference between a separate input and an adjustment to an existing input?,"As a result of the restriction being included in the transaction price, a separate input or an adjustment to an existing input is not required at the transaction date to reflect the effect of the restriction on transfer."
what is the fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature?,"""The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (eg a demand deposit) is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid."
what is the definition of fair value?,"If the entity manages that group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of its net exposure [Refer:paragraph 49] to either market risks or credit risk, the entity is permitted to apply an exception to this IFRS for measuring fair value."
what is the exception for a company?,"""An entity is permitted to use the exception in paragraph 48 only if the entity does all the following: [Refer:Basis for Conclusions paragraphs BC120 and BC121] (a) manages the group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the entity’s net exposure to a particular market risk (or risks) or to the credit risk of a particular counterparty in accordance with the entity’s documented risk management or investment strategy; (b) provides information on that basis about the group of financial assets and financial liabilities to the entity’s key management personnel, as defined in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures; and (c) is required or has elected to measure those financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value in the statement of financial position at the end of each reporting period."

what is the definition of a financial asset?,"6] The references to financial assets and financial liabilities in paragraphs 48–51 and 53–56 should be read as applying to all contracts within the scope of, and accounted for in accordance with, IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, if IFRS 9 has not yet been adopted), regardless of whether they meet the definitions of financial assets [Refer:IAS 32 paragraph 11 (definition of a financial asset)] or financial liabilities [Refer:IAS 32 paragraph 11 (definition of a financial liability)] in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation."
what is the exception in paragraph 48 to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets?,"""When using the exception in paragraph 48 to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities managed on the basis of the entity’s net exposure to a particular market risk (or risks), the entity shall apply the price within the bidask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances to the entity’s net exposure to those market risks (see paragraphs 70 and 71)."
What does the exception mean?,"""When using the exception in paragraph 48, an entity shall ensure that the market risk (or risks) to which the entity is exposed within that group of financial assets and financial liabilities is substantially the same."

what is the effect of the exception in paragraph 48?,"""When using the exception in paragraph 48 to measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities entered into with a particular counterparty, the entity shall include the effect of the entity’s net exposure to the credit risk of that counterparty or the counterparty’s net exposure to the credit risk of the entity in the fair value measurement when market participants [Refer:paragraphs 22 and 23] would take into account any existing arrangements that mitigate credit risk exposure in the event of default (eg a master netting agreement [Refer:IAS 32 paragraph 50] with the counterparty or an agreement that requires the exchange of collateral on the basis of each party’s net exposure to the credit risk of the other party)."
Do entities sell assets at the prices paid to acquire them?,Entities do not necessarily sell assets at the prices paid to acquire them.
what is the value of the transaction?,In many cases the transaction price will equal the fair value (eg that might be the case when on the transaction date the transaction to buy an asset takes place in the market in which the asset would be sold).
What is the definition of fair value?,"""When determining whether fair value at initial recognition equals the transaction price, an entity shall take into account factors specific to the transaction and to the asset or liability."
what is the IFRS for a liability?,"""If another IFRS requires or permits an entity to measure an asset or a liability initially at fair value and the transaction price differs from fair value, the entity shall recognise the resulting gain or loss in profit or loss unless that IFRS specifies otherwise."
What is the purpose of the paragraphs 67 and 74?,"""An entity shall use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs."
What is the main aspect of the valuation technique?,"[Refer:paragraph 2] Three widely used valuation techniques are the market approach, the cost approach and the income approach."
What is the definition of a fair value measurement?,A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.
What is the purpose of the paragraph?,"""If the transaction price is fair value at initial recognition [Refer:paragraphs 57–60 and B4] and a valuation technique that uses unobservable inputs will be used to measure fair value in subsequent periods, the valuation technique shall be calibrated so that at initial recognition the result of the valuation technique equals the transaction price."
"What happens if, for example, any of the following events take place?","That might be the case if, for example, any of the following events take place: (a) new markets develop; (b) new information becomes available; (c) information previously used is no longer available; (d) valuation techniques improve; or (e) market conditions change."

What is the difference between a bid price and an ask price?,"""If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price (eg an input from a dealer market), the price within the bidask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances shall be used to measure fair value regardless of where the input is categorised within the fair value hierarchy (ie Level 1, 2 or 3; see paragraphs 72–90)."
What is the purpose of this IFRS?,This IFRS does not preclude the use of midmarket pricing or other pricing conventions that are used by market participants as a practical expedient for fair value measurements within a bidask spread.
What is the purpose of the Fair Value hierarchy?,"""To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, this IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels (see paragraphs 76–90) the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value."
What is the definition of fair value?,"""In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised within different levels of the fair value hierarchy."
What is the level of fair value hierarchy?,"For example, a fair value measurement developed using a present value technique [Refer:paragraphs B12–B30] might be categorised within Level 2 [Refer:paragraphs 81–85, B35 and Basis for Conclusions paragraph BC171] or Level 3, depending on the inputs that are significant to the entire measurement and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which those inputs are categorised."
What is the definition of fair value?,"""If an observable input requires an adjustment using an unobservable input and that adjustment results in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, the resulting measurement would be categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
what is level 1 inputs?,Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
what is the best way to measure fair value?,"""A quoted price in an active market [Refer:Basis for Conclusions paragraph BC169] provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available, except as specified in paragraph 79."
What is the emphasis within Level 1 on?,"Therefore, the emphasis within Level 1 is on determining both of the following: (a) the principal market [Refer:Illustrative Examples, example 6] for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability [Refer:paragraph 16]; and (b) whether the entity can enter into a transaction for the asset or liability at the price in that market at the measurement date."
What does the fair value measurement mean?,"However, if the quoted price is adjusted for new information, the adjustment results in a fair value measurement categorised within a lower level of the fair value hierarchy."
what is the fair value of a position in a single asset or liability?,"""If an entity holds a position in a single asset or liability (including a position comprising a large number of identical assets or liabilities, such as a holding of financial instruments) and the asset or liability is traded in an active market, the fair value of the asset or liability shall be measured within Level 1 as the product of the quoted price for the individual asset or liability and the quantity held by the entity."
"What is the definition of ""Level 2 inputs""?","""Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly."
What are the inputs that are observable for the asset or liability?,"(c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, for example: (i) interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals; (ii) implied volatilities; and (iii) credit spreads."
What are the factors that affect the level 2 inputs?,"""Adjustments to Level 2 inputs will vary depending on factors specific to the asset or liability [Refer:paragraph B35]."
what is the fair value of a measurement?,An adjustment to a Level 2 input that is significant to the entire measurement might result in a fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy if the adjustment uses significant unobservable inputs.
what is the use of Level 2 inputs for particular assets and liabilities?,Paragraph B35 describes the use of Level 2 inputs for particular assets and liabilities.
what is level 3 inputs for the asset or liability?,Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
What is the fair value objective?,"However, the fair value measurement objective [Refer:paragraph 2] remains the same, ie an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant [Refer:paragraphs 22 and 23] that holds the asset or owes the liability."
What is the definition of a fair value measurement?,A measurement that does not include an adjustment for risk would not represent a fair value measurement if market participants would include one when pricing the asset or liability.
What is the objective of a fair value measurement?,Unobservable inputs developed in the manner described above are considered market participant assumptions and meet the objective of a fair value measurement.
what is the use of Level 3 inputs for particular assets and liabilities?,Paragraph B36 describes the use of Level 3 inputs for particular assets and liabilities.
What is the effect of the measurements on profit or loss or other comprehensive income for the period?,"(b) for recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), [Refer:paragraph 86] the effect of the measurements on profit or loss or other comprehensive income for the period."
